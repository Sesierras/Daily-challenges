1
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,201
Dad, Dad.

2
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:44,872
It's okay, sweetie.

3
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,279
Dad, Dad. Dad, help me!

4
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:54,048
Dad, please help me!

5
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:55,783
Please help me, please!

6
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,788
<i>And, um, I guess...</i>

7
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,924
Yeah, and then I woke up.

8
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:05,158
Why didn't I do anything?

9
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,293
I don't know.

10
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,363
It's like the third time now.

11
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,433
Why am I always just
standing there?

12
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:16,638
Don't make her feel guilty
about her dreams, Paul.

13
00:02:17,572 --> 00:02:19,139
You don't see me
that way, right?

14
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,943
That's not how you think
I'd react in real life.

15
00:02:22,043 --> 00:02:23,477
If I was floating?

16
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,345
Do you remember that time
you almost drowned?

17
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,147
How fast I reacted.

18
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,415
She was four.

19
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:30,118
I remember you
telling me about it.

20
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,285
-Bye.
-Hannah!

21
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,321
Remember you have to
stay home with Sophie tonight.

22
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,090
No, that's tomorrow night.

23
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:38,458
No, the play is tonight.
It was always tonight.

24
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,129
Really, she can't be alone
for, like, a few hours?

25
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,162
I don't mind.

26
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,731
You already agreed to this.

27
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,667
Okay, fine. Bye.

28
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,236
So, should I just meet
you there, or...

29
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,605
Yeah, probably.

30
00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,007
I'm not sure how long
it'll take with Sheila, so...

31
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:55,076
-Are you nervous?
-No, not really.

32
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,778
I... I think it'll be good.

33
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:57,679
I think she'll understand,

34
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:01,115
hopefully apologize
and that'll be that.

35
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,750
Can you record it?

36
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,018
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

37
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,887
Just the audio
on your phone.

38
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,187
I want to hear
how she reacts.

39
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,356
Oh, wow.

40
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:11,759
So vindictive, Janet.

41
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:15,195
Yeah, I'll think about it.

42
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,698
But you should go,
you're gonna be late.

43
00:03:16,798 --> 00:03:17,832
No, I'll be fine.

44
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,836
-Have a good one.
-You, too.

45
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:26,473
<i>So, when talking about</i>
<i>adaptive strategies,</i>

46
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,309
why does the zebra look
the way it does?

47
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:31,546
You can spot it miles away,

48
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:34,448
so it's not
very functional, right?

49
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:37,417
Any theory on how
the black and white stripes

50
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:38,786
could be a benefit?

51
00:03:41,756 --> 00:03:42,757
No one?

52
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:49,197
From what we know,
the camouflage isn't effective

53
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,666
in terms of blending in
with the environment.

54
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,267
Rather, it's about
blending in with the herd.

55
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,704
You see, predators need
to identify their prey.

56
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,773
They can't just attack
the whole group.

57
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,510
So, if you stick your head out,
you make yourself a target.

58
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,046
-Yeah.
-Does that make sense?

59
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:09,282
Hi. Hey, focus.

60
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,552
-Is this how it went?
-No, it's different now.

61
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,021
Do you want to share
your discussion with the class?

62
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,388
Sorry. No.

63
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,191
Okay, because you just made
yourselves a target

64
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,760
by speaking when
you weren't supposed to.

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,161
You get the analogy?

66
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,294
I get the analogy.

67
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:23,430
Okay, good. So, in contrast,

68
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,467
can anyone think of instances
where sticking out

69
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:30,303
can be an evolutionary benefit?

70
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,572
-Yes.
-Uh, mating?

71
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,472
Mating.

72
00:04:32,573 --> 00:04:34,108
Welcome to Madre.

73
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,344
Hi, I have a table, for Paul.

74
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:42,517
What?

75
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:44,351
I'm sorry, don't I know you?

76
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,753
I don't know, do you?

77
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,421
Yeah, I...

78
00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:51,125
Well, Osler, maybe. I'm...
I'm a professor there.

79
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:53,127
No. No, I didn't go there.

80
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:55,395
-Have you been
with us lately?
-No.

81
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,332
Yeah. Okay, uh, sorry.
I'm just...

82
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,970
some major deja vu or...

83
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,006
-Brian, right?
-Paul.

84
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,529
Hi, Paul.

85
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,231
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

86
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,266
Yeah, it's been
too long, Sheila.

87
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,535
I barely recognized you.
Wow.

88
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,436
Oh, yeah?
The beard maybe?

89
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:40,007
No, it's the whole,
you know...

90
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:46,714
So, how long are you
in town for?

91
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,550
Just a few days,
visiting my brother.

92
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,952
How's everything with you?

93
00:05:51,052 --> 00:05:54,222
-You're still at
Osler, right?
-Yeah, I am.

94
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,061
And you're publishing
another paper, I heard.

95
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:04,131
Oh, yeah, uh,
we're just doing
final revisions now.

96
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,333
So, it's... it's looking good.

97
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,768
Where'd you end up?
Which publication?

98
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:10,437
Uh, do you want to...
Should we look at the menu?

99
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:12,840
Yeah.
Which publication, though?

100
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,775
Uh, <i>Nature.</i>

101
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,177
<i>Nature?</i>

102
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,545
Yeah. We're happy about that.

103
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:19,947
I mean, it's been
a while, so, yeah.

104
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:33,527
<i>Why haven't</i>
<i>you contacted me?</i>

105
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,428
<i>What?</i>
<i>Why am I not</i>
<i>being credited?</i>

106
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,664
<i>What do you mean?</i>

107
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:39,200
<i>Oh, come on,</i>
<i>swarm intelligence?</i>

108
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,135
<i>Ant colony algorithms?</i>

109
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,270
Yeah.

110
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,372
Sounds awfully similar
to my research now.

111
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,375
Well, I... Do you mean
from grad school?

112
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,043
Yes. You weren't
even interested

113
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,244
in networks back then.

114
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,079
You were all about
senescence.

115
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:55,016
Yes, I... I... I mean,
I've expanded my interests

116
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:56,851
over the last 30 years.

117
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,388
Are you using
"antelligence"? You know
I coined that, right?

118
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,623
I'm not using
"antelligence."

119
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:05,660
Look, there's a big difference
between talking about an idea

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,662
and actually
doing all the work.

121
00:07:07,762 --> 00:07:10,765
No, no, I've been working.
I've got a book.

122
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:14,201
Uh, do you have
a publisher?

123
00:07:14,302 --> 00:07:17,305
Well, I... I want
to finish it
before I take it out.

124
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,806
I don't want
to be influenced by

125
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:20,541
any sort of corporate agenda.

126
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:22,710
-Can I read a draft, or...
-Oh, why?

127
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,613
-Do you need more material?
-Oh, come on, Paul.

128
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,381
Let's be adults here.

129
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,283
How far along are you?

130
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:32,286
Well, I haven't really started
the actual sitting down

131
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,689
and writing portion
of it yet, but...

132
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,024
<i>So, this kind of ruins</i>
<i>everything for me, Sheila.</i>

133
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,860
<i>It's just a complete</i>
<i>appropriation. I mean...</i>

134
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,064
Can you at least
just credit me?

135
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,866
There's nothing
wrong with just being
a professor, Paul.

136
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,768
You don't need to be
a researcher, too.

137
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:52,406
<i>Please, Sheila. I need this.</i>

138
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:20,534
-Paul.
-Jan.

139
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,136
-Hi.
-You got the tickets?

140
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:23,771
Yeah. How'd it go?

141
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,406
What, oh,
you mean with Sheila?

142
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,540
Yeah.

143
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,575
Yeah. Well, yeah,
you know, it's technical.

144
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,577
I mean, she totally
saw my argument,

145
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,013
but we didn't fully,
you know, resolve it yet.

146
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:34,415
Really? So, what's next?

147
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,549
I'll figure it out.

148
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,351
Okay. Well, was she defensive?

149
00:08:37,451 --> 00:08:39,787
-Did you record it?
-No, no.

150
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:44,358
It kind of felt, you know,
unethical or whatever.

151
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,627
-You want to go inside?
-Yeah.

152
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,917
Paul. Paul!

153
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,953
Ah!
I thought that was you.

154
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,321
-Claire?
-Yeah.

155
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:16,023
Hi, my God.

156
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:18,092
Oh, it's so good to see you.

157
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,593
You just saw the play?

158
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,629
Duh, yeah. Of course.

159
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:24,165
-This is my wife, Janet.
-Oh, hi.

160
00:09:24,265 --> 00:09:25,800
-Hi.
-I'm Claire.

161
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,568
-Hello, Janet.
-When did you get married?

162
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:30,539
Oh, wow. That's about,
well, let's see...

163
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,907
-15 years.
-Yeah, 15 years ago.

164
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,909
I'm so glad I ran into you.

165
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,811
You've been on my mind
a lot lately.

166
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,679
I'm sorry. How do you
two know each other?

167
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,550
Oh, well,
Claire and I used to date.

168
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,250
Yeah.

169
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,019
Wild right?

170
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,254
Anyway, you've been on
my mind recently.

171
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:51,592
Yeah? I, uh...
I haven't thought
about you in a while.

172
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:55,096
Okay. Good to know, I guess.

173
00:09:55,196 --> 00:09:57,098
Anyway, the reason that
you've been on my mind

174
00:09:57,198 --> 00:09:59,767
is because you keep
popping up in my dreams.

175
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,402
-Really?
-Yeah.

176
00:10:01,503 --> 00:10:03,003
Like, a lot
in the last few weeks.

177
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,872
It's so strange.

178
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:06,740
You don't do anything.
You're just there,

179
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:10,111
even if the dream's
completely unrelated to you.

180
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:11,112
Like the other night,

181
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:13,881
a good friend of mine
was lying in the street,

182
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:17,218
<i>hit by a car, bleeding,</i>
<i>dying in my arms, right?</i>

183
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,653
And then... this is just
in the dream, of course.

184
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,956
<i>And out of nowhere,</i>

185
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:25,126
<i>there you are,</i>
<i>just strolling by.</i>

186
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:31,732
Wow. I'm... Well, I mean,
that is so strange.

187
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:34,869
So, I don't intervene at all?
I... I don't help out?

188
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,770
You're still doing that?

189
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:39,508
-What?
-Searching for the insult.

190
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:42,109
No, you don't do anything,
but it's not like I blame you.

191
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,613
I was just gonna say
that my therapist

192
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:45,913
suggested that I reach out.

193
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:50,918
That maybe you and I
need to sort something out,

194
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,453
you know, subconsciously.

195
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:55,256
Did... did you know
he was here?

196
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:58,159
No, no, no, I just happened
to see you guys,

197
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,461
which feels like a sign,
you know, synchronicity.

198
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:02,830
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

199
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,765
Do you think we can grab
a coffee or something?

200
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:07,268
You know,
just catch up and stuff?

201
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,737
Yeah, we... we can do that.
Sure, why not?

202
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,540
I mean, you know...

203
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,508
Should I take your number?

204
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:14,742
Oh, uh...

205
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:17,444
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay.

206
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,813
Put your number in there.

207
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:23,984
-Did you like the play?
-I did, yeah. Yeah.

208
00:11:27,488 --> 00:11:28,789
What, you changed
your last name?

209
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,925
Yeah, I took hers.
We thought it was...

210
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,728
I thought it was appropriate.
I wanted to.

211
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:35,996
Right.

212
00:11:36,096 --> 00:11:37,431
Why'd you get all red?

213
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, I was just taken aback
by the whole situation.

214
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,969
Wouldn't you react the same

215
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,905
if some old boyfriend
just cornered you like that?

216
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,941
I don't think I'd turn
into a stuttering fool.

217
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,677
I don't think
I was stuttering.

218
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:50,144
She seemed
really happy to see you.

219
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:53,714
Well, yeah, but not becau...
It's because of these dreams.

220
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:55,216
Why are you defending her?

221
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:58,018
Are you just
trying to pick a fight
with me right now?

222
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,821
No, I'm just nervous what
this woman will do to you

223
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,558
-when I'm not there.
-Do to me?

224
00:12:03,658 --> 00:12:05,192
What's she gonna do to me?

225
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,195
Jump me?

226
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:10,998
Why did you ask if
she was married?

227
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:14,368
I was
making conversation.

228
00:12:14,468 --> 00:12:17,371
Okay. Well, maybe
I'm exaggerating a little bit,

229
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:20,508
but I would be lying if I said
I wasn't worried at all.

230
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,409
That's fair.

231
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:26,046
But I'm just meeting her
for coffee, that's it.

232
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,449
I love you.

233
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,420
Have you ever fantasized
about other women?

234
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,792
Yeah, of course, I have.

235
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,995
-But never cheated?
-Oh, my God, Janet.

236
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,564
Do you really think
I'm that cool?

237
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:43,897
Do you think I could handle

238
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:46,267
the emotional burden
of having an affair?

239
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,902
No. No, you're right.

240
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:51,872
Just try not to let
your neuroticism hijack you.

241
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:55,175
Oh, come on. Not the gender
psychology bullshit again.

242
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,444
We both know you score high
in neuroticism.

243
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:59,980
It's best to just own it
and be pragmatic about it.

244
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,553
Yeah. Well, you score high in,
uh, in... "assholeness."

245
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,022
I... I score high in
"assholeness"?

246
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:11,792
-Yeah. So, just own it.
-Be pragmatic about it.

247
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,263
How about this?

248
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:19,567
I'll keep it very formal
when I meet her.

249
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,168
I won't even smile.

250
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,138
-She might like that.
-What?

251
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,607
-She might like that.
-Oh, no.

252
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:27,041
Yeah, it's just so...

253
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,942
Well, it's just
so intense, you know?

254
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:31,045
And I usually don't even
remember my dreams.

255
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:34,683
Wow. I... I feel like
I want to apologize

256
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:37,351
for barging into
your head like that.

257
00:13:37,451 --> 00:13:40,789
No, it's okay.
It's just funny, you know?

258
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,823
Anyway, thanks
for meeting me.

259
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:44,024
Of course.

260
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,260
Um, there's actually, um...

261
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,662
there's something
I want to ask you.

262
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:49,430
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

263
00:13:49,531 --> 00:13:50,864
What?

264
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,334
Would it be okay if
I wrote about this?

265
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,402
What do you mean?
In... in what way?

266
00:13:55,503 --> 00:13:57,971
Well, I write for this magazine
called The New Inquiry.

267
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:00,374
Really? You're publishing?

268
00:14:00,474 --> 00:14:01,475
It's just online.

269
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,411
It's more like a blog.
Nobody really reads it.

270
00:14:04,512 --> 00:14:06,947
What... what sort of
stuff do you write about?

271
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:09,216
Mostly psychology.
Jungian stuff.

272
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,585
-Oh.
-Yeah, okay.

273
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:11,820
I knew you'd scoff at that.

274
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,755
Sorry,
I didn't mean to.

275
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:15,956
What, you want
to write about me?

276
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,125
No, I want to write
about the dreams.

277
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,394
About randomly
seeing you, just that.

278
00:14:20,494 --> 00:14:22,963
It's just... it's just very
on brand from what I do.

279
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,499
I mean, yeah,
if you don't portray me

280
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,236
as this inadequate loser,
like in your dreams.

281
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,839
You're
seriously insulted.

282
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:34,241
No, of course not.
I'm joking.

283
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,543
So, you'd be okay with it?

284
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:38,278
-Yes. Yeah. Go ahead.
-Yes.

285
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,748
Thank you. Yes.

286
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,187
-What?
-No, it's...

287
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:52,393
just my wife suspected
you had ulterior motives.

288
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:53,894
Like what?

289
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,632
Well, that you still
had feelings for me,

290
00:14:57,732 --> 00:14:59,667
that you missed me.

291
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,770
Wait... really?

292
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,271
That's so funny.
Why would she say that?

293
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,542
Oh, I... I mean,
I don't know, I...

294
00:15:07,642 --> 00:15:10,077
Oh, shoot, I have to run.

295
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,881
Um, well, thank you.

296
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,483
-Thanks for
doing this, really.
-Sure.

297
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:20,387
I guess I'll, uh... I guess
I'll see you in my dreams.

298
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:23,490
Yeah, of course not.

299
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:25,392
Thanks.

300
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:30,964
Is it him?

301
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,933
-It's Paul for sure.
-That's so weird.

302
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,468
We're basically
having the same dream.

303
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:36,303
I know, it's so
random. It's just, like,

304
00:15:36,403 --> 00:15:38,972
Paul, every night
for some reason.

305
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:40,974
-Hi.
-Hey.

306
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:42,176
You guys good?

307
00:15:42,276 --> 00:15:43,977
-Yeah. You?
-Yeah.

308
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,884
So amazing.

309
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,993
What?

310
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,261
Have you been
dreaming about me?

311
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:03,263
Have I been
dreaming about you?

312
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:04,933
Yeah.

313
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,601
Ever in my life, you mean?

314
00:16:06,701 --> 00:16:08,603
No, recently.

315
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,371
I don't know. I don't keep
track of things like that.

316
00:16:13,608 --> 00:16:16,076
You're kind of
freaking me out.
What's going on?

317
00:16:16,477 --> 00:16:17,478
Nothing.

318
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,316
Can we please put
our phones away

319
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,284
and have
a real conversation?

320
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,524
So, how was school today,
Sophie?

321
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,193
-Dad.
-It's fine,

322
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:34,529
I'll call them back later.

323
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,797
Tell me about your day.

324
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,264
Can you turn
the sound off at least?

325
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:38,766
Yes, I'll do that next time.

326
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,267
It'll stop soon.

327
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:45,172
Sophie, didn't you
guys decide which
character you're going to

328
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:47,742
-be for the...
for the play or...
-Yeah.

329
00:16:50,712 --> 00:16:51,746
Let me just hang up.

330
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:56,483
I have to take this.

331
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:57,619
That's not allowed.

332
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:59,052
Richard, hi.

333
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,955
<i>Is this a good time?</i>
<i>You have a minute?</i>

334
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:02,857
Yeah. What's going on?

335
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:05,627
<i>So, uh, where do I start?</i>

336
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:07,494
Oh, wow. It sounds serious.

337
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:08,863
<i>No, it's funny.</i>

338
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:12,165
<i>You know sometimes I have</i>
<i>these dinner parties, right?</i>

339
00:17:12,266 --> 00:17:14,869
Yeah. Is this finally
the invite?

340
00:17:14,969 --> 00:17:17,805
<i>No, it's, uh...</i>
<i>I just had one.</i>

341
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:20,040
Oh, okay, and?

342
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,011
-So, I've told my husband
this ad nauseam,

343
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,245
but it's about
a recurring dream I've had,

344
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:26,981
or not so much
a specific dream

345
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,216
but a specific person
I keep dreaming about.

346
00:17:29,316 --> 00:17:32,020
He looks perfectly average.

347
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:35,322
He's a remarkable nobody
that just shows up.

348
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:39,059
He just occupies the space
like an awkward guest

349
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,228
at a party
that no one really knows.

350
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,564
You mean like Sydney?

351
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:45,065
Yeah.

352
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,868
No, I mean...

353
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:50,270
I have also... I've...
I've also had that experience.

354
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,639
I already
told Richard about it.

355
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:54,709
-I did, I told you...
-Yes, and I'm kind of upset,

356
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:56,143
to tell you the truth.

357
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,946
She's dreaming
about another man.

358
00:17:58,046 --> 00:17:59,814
Yeah, very
similar to yours, Naomi.

359
00:17:59,914 --> 00:18:03,183
Except in my case,
it's this... this guy
that we sort of know.

360
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:05,118
This old friend
of Richard's, Paul.

361
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,922
Well, we went to
the same university.

362
00:18:08,022 --> 00:18:10,858
He's actually
not that memorable.

363
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:12,594
He's kind of boring.

364
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:15,128
I... I don't get
why you're so into him.

365
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:16,698
I'm not into him.

366
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:18,131
So, what does he look like?

367
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,134
Well, he does actually
kind of look like Sydney.

368
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,772
Do you have a picture?

369
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,260
Paul?

370
00:18:49,097 --> 00:18:50,665
Oh, my God.

371
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,867
-Paul. Paul!
<i>-Hello.</i>

372
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,334
Oh, my God.

373
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,503
<i>Are you there?</i>
Hey, what...

374
00:18:55,603 --> 00:18:56,871
what happened?

375
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:58,840
Hey.

376
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,587
Janet!

377
00:19:12,687 --> 00:19:16,223
There... there... there's,
like, 100 messages on here.

378
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,558
Probably Claire's article.

379
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:21,361
She must have linked it
to my profile or something.

380
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,363
Somebody wants
to interview me.

381
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,832
Why are you so excited?

382
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:28,168
-Why? What's wrong?
-This is strange, Paul.

383
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,538
Maybe you should
take a minute and think

384
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,507
before you do
anything drastic.

385
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:41,314
Why me?
Uh, I don't know,

386
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:42,984
I'm special, I guess.

387
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:46,087
<i>An area man</i>
<i>has found himself</i>
<i>at the center of</i>

388
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,789
<i>a strange dream epidemic,</i>

389
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:50,725
<i>which scientists are</i>
<i>struggling to make sense of.</i>

390
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:53,661
<i>So we</i>
<i>actually don't know</i>
<i>what's causing this,</i>

391
00:19:53,761 --> 00:19:57,932
<i>but it's sort of like a dream</i>
<i>version of the Mandela effect,</i>

392
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:00,333
<i>which is when multiple</i>
<i>people report having the same</i>

393
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:02,537
<i>false memory without</i>
<i>any logical explanation.</i>

394
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:04,038
<i>Now, then</i>
<i>there's something called</i>

395
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,374
<i>-astral projections, right?</i>
-No, Mom, I don't know.

396
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,443
<i>This is a spiritual</i>
<i>type of dream visitation.</i>

397
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,478
<i>Scientifically,</i>
<i>this is dubious, of course,</i>

398
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:13,380
<i>-but it has been reported.</i>
-I didn't do anything.

399
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,584
<i>It... it's a very interesting</i>
<i>time in my field...</i>

400
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,753
This is gonna be so weird
to explain at school.

401
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:21,488
<i>Our online poll</i>
<i>shows thousands of reports</i>
<i>of the phenomenon.</i>

402
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:24,959
What are you getting
so upset for, Mom? I'm fine.

403
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:26,994
I'm missing
the whole segment now.

404
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,797
<i>But I'm always</i>
<i>inclined to think, rationally,</i>

405
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:31,331
<i>that anything supernatural</i>

406
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,734
<i>has to be socially</i>
<i>constructed.</i>

407
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,904
<i>But this one is, uh,</i>
<i>mysterious, even for me.</i>

408
00:20:53,187 --> 00:20:57,390
Okay. Okay.
Please calm down.

409
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:58,893
Calm down.

410
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,427
Thank you.

411
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,163
Who's really here for
the lecture on kin selection?

412
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,931
Show of hands.

413
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,134
Okay, the rest of you,
I'll give you five minutes

414
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:07,869
before I start
the lecture, okay?

415
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:09,137
Ask me anything.

416
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:10,204
Yes, you?

417
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,739
How does it feel to go viral?

418
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,273
Huh.

419
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:16,043
Well, we can discuss that
when we get to memetics

420
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,410
later this year.

421
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:19,781
-Yes, you?
-Why is this happening?

422
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,215
I have no clue.

423
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:23,050
My guess would
be as good as yours.

424
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:26,754
Are you gonna do, like,
Stephen Colbert or anything?

425
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,488
Oh, not a chance.

426
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:31,759
I actually enjoy my anonymity,
if you can believe that.

427
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,493
Okay. You!

428
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,563
I think maybe I had
a dream about you

429
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,932
but it's, like,
super blurry and, like,

430
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:39,901
I wanna, like,
be better at remembering them.

431
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:43,303
-And, uh, how do I do that?
-I'm not really an expert here.

432
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:46,707
Keeping a dream journal
is a common exercise,

433
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,943
but isn't seeing
me in class enough?

434
00:21:50,578 --> 00:21:53,380
Who's certain they've
actually had a dream about me?

435
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:56,150
Okay.
Let's explore this.

436
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,119
This might get us
somewhere interesting.

437
00:21:58,219 --> 00:22:00,655
Does anyone want to share
the content of their dream?

438
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:03,925
-Yes, you?
-Well, um.

439
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,358
I'm in this forest,

440
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:09,130
<i>wandering around,</i>
<i>eating these strange mushrooms,</i>

441
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,700
<i>and I'm in, like,</i>
<i>a full tuxedo for some reason.</i>

442
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,468
<i>And there's other</i>
<i>people also dressed up,</i>

443
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,575
<i>but they're all scared,</i>
<i>like, frozen in fear.</i>

444
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:22,577
<i>And then I realize</i>
<i>it's because of this</i>

445
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:24,712
<i>really tall man</i>
<i>running towards me.</i>

446
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:48,769
Hide.

447
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,139
Are you talking to me?

448
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,742
Yes, Paul, he'll kill us.

449
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:55,576
Paul!

450
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:57,377
I've never seen these.

451
00:22:58,112 --> 00:22:59,379
Beautiful.

452
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,382
No! No!

453
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:05,987
And that's all I remember.

454
00:23:06,087 --> 00:23:07,755
Ah. Interesting.

455
00:23:07,855 --> 00:23:11,525
So, I'm looking
at the mushrooms

456
00:23:11,626 --> 00:23:14,762
-instead of helping?
-Oh, I suppose, yeah.

457
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,899
Okay, let's hear
another one. Anyone?

458
00:23:43,691 --> 00:23:47,328
Okay, so,
I'm just observing again.

459
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,196
But that's funny.

460
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,032
Interesting one.

461
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:52,600
Anyone else?

462
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,741
Huh.

463
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,289
-It ends like that?
-Yeah.

464
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:17,725
That's, uh,
that's all I can remember.

465
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:20,561
Does anyone have
a more original one?

466
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,931
Maybe one where
I'm actually doing something.

467
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,002
No one?

468
00:24:28,102 --> 00:24:29,837
Okay, well,
let's just hear them anyway.

469
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:32,707
Who's next?

470
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,985
Dad.

471
00:24:44,085 --> 00:24:45,853
Oh, my God, delete that.

472
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:47,722
No, it's fine.
I'm just sending it to Kyle.

473
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:49,657
-Who's Kyle?
-Tammy's friend.

474
00:24:49,757 --> 00:24:51,625
He doesn't believe
you're my dad for some reason.

475
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:54,028
Oh, you guys are flirting?

476
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:57,398
No, um, he was
just asking about you.

477
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,700
So, I'm finally cool, huh?

478
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,535
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

479
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:02,636
You hear that, Janet?

480
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:04,171
She's saying
I'm a cool dad now.

481
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:06,240
I didn't...
I didn't say that.

482
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,708
Can you drive
me to school today?

483
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:10,411
-You want me to?
-Mm-hmm.

484
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,612
I guess I can make it.

485
00:25:11,712 --> 00:25:14,181
-Janet, does that work?
-Yeah, take her.

486
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:18,019
Dude, this is so insane.

487
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,788
Like, how's he
dealing with all this?

488
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:24,158
We're not even the type
of people that like attention,

489
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,259
-you know?
-Right.

490
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:27,495
So, the whole
thing is so bizarre.

491
00:25:27,595 --> 00:25:29,563
So bizarre.
So bizarre.

492
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:32,333
My sister is actually, like,

493
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,769
starstruck that I know you,
you know?

494
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:36,303
She sent me this
article and she's like,

495
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,638
"Check this guy out, Paul."

496
00:25:37,738 --> 00:25:40,674
And I was like,
"Uh, that's Paul Matthews.

497
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:41,876
"I know his wife."

498
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:44,245
-That's so funny.
-Yeah. Also, I was listening

499
00:25:44,345 --> 00:25:45,880
to this podcast that I like.

500
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,615
They were talking about Paul.

501
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,116
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

502
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,686
They were relating Paul to,
like, this old internet meme.

503
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,555
And then they were
talking about how, like,

504
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,657
all memes will become dreams

505
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,726
-or something like that.
-Oh, that's interesting.

506
00:25:58,826 --> 00:25:59,894
It is interesting.

507
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:02,163
How is the museum going,
by the way?

508
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:03,364
-The what?
-The museum.

509
00:26:03,464 --> 00:26:04,498
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

510
00:26:04,598 --> 00:26:05,933
No, it's good. It's good.

511
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,668
I feel like there's
a few challenges for us

512
00:26:07,768 --> 00:26:09,737
to still wrap up,
but overall it's going good.

513
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,005
Thanks for asking.

514
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:12,006
-Great.
-Mm-hmm.

515
00:26:12,106 --> 00:26:13,941
-I know it's not my project...
-Mm-hmm.

516
00:26:14,041 --> 00:26:17,178
...but I'd love to
be involved somehow.

517
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,612
Oh, yeah.

518
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:19,947
No, thanks. I mean, I...

519
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:22,049
I feel like we're
in a pretty good position.

520
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:23,217
Yeah. You know,

521
00:26:23,317 --> 00:26:26,555
just if you want to bounce
ideas or want some feedback.

522
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:31,926
Yeah. No. Yeah, I think,
uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

523
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:35,729
You just want to bounce ideas
back and maybe just... yeah.

524
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,665
I thought
you weren't on that project.

525
00:26:37,765 --> 00:26:39,667
Well, I wasn't,
but now Chris wants me on.

526
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,001
Well, that's great.

527
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:43,003
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you.

528
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:45,172
We also got an invite
to one of Richard's famous

529
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:46,307
dinner parties.

530
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:49,477
-Really? When?
-On the 5th.

531
00:26:49,578 --> 00:26:52,780
Can you believe it,
after all these years?

532
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,784
I was tempted to say no,
but I think we should go.

533
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:59,253
-Hey, Paul.
-Yeah?

534
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:01,722
Why do you suppose you're
not showing up in my dreams?

535
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:03,958
Well, because
you get the real deal.

536
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,860
It wouldn't
be fair if you got both.

537
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:10,064
-Are you jealous?
-I don't know. I mean,

538
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:12,567
-rationally, I'm not, but...
-Then maybe I should

539
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,034
give you a little visit.

540
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,605
What would you want me to do?

541
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:19,473
What would you want
to see in your dream?

542
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:24,945
Wow. Um...
I want to see you...

543
00:27:27,014 --> 00:27:29,016
Remember when you wore
that Talking Heads suit

544
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:30,519
for Halloween?

545
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,652
Yeah.

546
00:27:31,752 --> 00:27:33,420
There was just
something about it.

547
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:35,823
Something kind
of weird and sexy.

548
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,459
You should
wear that and save me

549
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,661
from, like, some situation.

550
00:27:42,863 --> 00:27:44,599
That's your sexual fantasy?

551
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,066
Sky's the limit here

552
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,069
and you sell it for me wearing
a comically large suit.

553
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,839
I don't know,
I'm not good under pressure.

554
00:27:51,939 --> 00:27:55,943
Just show up naked,
on a horse, with a huge penis.

555
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:57,845
-Is that better?
-Who has a huge penis?

556
00:27:57,945 --> 00:27:59,747
-Me or the horse?
-You.

557
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:01,115
I'm doing the David Byrne suit.

558
00:28:01,215 --> 00:28:03,150
-It's been decided.
-No, let me think about it.

559
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,084
No, no, no.

560
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:05,620
You immediately
said the suit and that's

561
00:28:05,719 --> 00:28:06,921
-what you're getting.
-Fine.

562
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:11,292
Do you think
other people are seeing

563
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,094
you naked in their dreams?

564
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,230
Does that turn you on?

565
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:19,300
Does it turn me on?

566
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,936
Maybe somebody's
dreaming about me right now.

567
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:25,139
-Yeah.
-Maybe a bunch of people,

568
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,341
at the same time.

569
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:29,611
How many?

570
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,514
Hundreds?
Maybe thousands?

571
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:35,849
Oh, that is
so irresponsible of you.

572
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,552
I can't accept that.

573
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:39,588
What are you
gonna do about it?

574
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:43,891
I'm gonna make sure
you stay right here.

575
00:29:50,024 --> 00:29:52,293
I have to kill you, Paul.

576
00:29:53,628 --> 00:29:54,862
I have to!

577
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:56,731
What are you...
what are you doing?

578
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,299
Who are you?

579
00:29:58,399 --> 00:29:59,601
Call the police.

580
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:00,769
What are you
doing in our house?

581
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:02,737
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Get out!

582
00:30:02,836 --> 00:30:04,104
Oh, my God.

583
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:06,173
Hannah,
Sophie, stay back!

584
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,074
Mom! Mom!

585
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,543
-Do something!
-Hannah...

586
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:11,412
Hannah, take Sophie
to your room and lock the door.

587
00:30:11,513 --> 00:30:13,113
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:15,983
-Put down the knife.
-I can't, I have to kill you.

589
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,217
Do something, Paul!

590
00:30:17,318 --> 00:30:19,453
I have to. I have to.

591
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,121
He's in our bedroom...

592
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:22,956
I have to kill you.

593
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,829
He's had manic
episodes in the past.

594
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:31,566
It seems that he stopped
taking his medications.

595
00:30:32,266 --> 00:30:33,967
So... so,
what's gonna happen to him?

596
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,937
A psych evaluation,
date with the court,

597
00:30:37,037 --> 00:30:38,606
and then
a judge will decide.

598
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:40,240
So, he might be back out?

599
00:30:41,442 --> 00:30:44,845
After possibly
serving a sentence, yes.

600
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:49,684
You know,
fame can come with some

601
00:30:49,784 --> 00:30:51,952
less-than-desirable
side effects.

602
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:54,288
Strangers might
want to talk to you,

603
00:30:54,388 --> 00:30:56,990
some of them might
be mentally unstable.

604
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:58,660
You should
be prepared for that.

605
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,893
I'm not getting a gun.

606
00:30:59,993 --> 00:31:02,564
Well, I'm not
necessarily talking weapons.

607
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:04,131
You have no alarm
in the house.

608
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:06,133
<i>You had</i>
<i>an unlocked entry point.</i>

609
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:07,968
<i>That makes you vulnerable.</i>

610
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:11,872
<i>You could consider a dog.</i>

611
00:31:11,972 --> 00:31:15,109
<i>Sophie,</i>
<i>our daughter, is allergic.</i>

612
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,545
<i>Well, then</i>
<i>you may want to consider</i>

613
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,046
<i>moving to a new house.</i>

614
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,582
<i>Keep your phone number</i>
<i>and address unlisted.</i>

615
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:23,250
<i>No, we're not moving,</i>
<i>I grew up in this house.</i>

616
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:26,821
<i>Security cameras, tasers,</i>

617
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,455
<i>strengthening your deadbolts,</i>

618
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:32,326
<i>securing your windows,</i>
<i>self-defense classes.</i>

619
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:35,530
It seems like you were pretty
helpless in this situation.

620
00:31:37,532 --> 00:31:39,433
Maybe we should
cool this thing off.

621
00:31:39,534 --> 00:31:42,302
You know, this is why
I was skeptical
in the first place.

622
00:31:42,403 --> 00:31:44,739
Oh, you knew specifically
that this would happen?

623
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,075
-This kind of thing, Paul.
-Strange consequences.

624
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:52,946
I think she's right.

625
00:31:53,046 --> 00:31:55,315
Take it as a warning.

626
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,852
I really feel like
you're playing with fire here.

627
00:31:57,951 --> 00:31:59,453
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

628
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:02,489
Going on TV,
playing along with the story.

629
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,894
This thing is clearly working
like catnip for lunatics.

630
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,162
What do you mean,
playing along?

631
00:32:08,262 --> 00:32:10,497
Do you actually
believe people are

632
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:11,833
randomly dreaming about you?

633
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,333
You don't think it's
because you're popping up

634
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:15,469
all over the news
and on the internet?

635
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,304
Yeah, maybe
that accounts for some of it,

636
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,373
but it doesn't
really explain everything.

637
00:32:19,473 --> 00:32:22,109
Okay, so, you think
something magical is happening?

638
00:32:22,209 --> 00:32:23,477
Well, why is it just me?

639
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,780
Why not you,
or anyone else for that matter?

640
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,148
So, you believe in metaphysics

641
00:32:28,248 --> 00:32:29,717
if it proves you're special?

642
00:32:30,518 --> 00:32:31,586
No.

643
00:32:33,521 --> 00:32:35,890
I don't know,
I'm still processing it.

644
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:37,859
But that guy was just
some delusional man

645
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,226
with his own wild ideas.

646
00:32:39,326 --> 00:32:41,995
I don't think that's
going to be a recurring event.

647
00:32:42,095 --> 00:32:43,464
But why risk it?

648
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:46,366
Well, if people know
who I am, it's just easier

649
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,202
for me to get
my foot in the door.

650
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,572
Which door are
we talking about here, Paul?

651
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:55,710
A publisher,
for the book I want to write.

652
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,412
Oh, okay.

653
00:32:58,513 --> 00:33:01,716
Am I sensing a little
midlife crisis here?

654
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,151
Oh, come on.

655
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:07,020
You're the one who just
bought a fucking Kawasaki!

656
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,690
Okay. Calm down.

657
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,475
-Paul?
-Hi, yes.

658
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,545
Hi, I'm Molly.
They're ready for you upstairs.

659
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:31,613
Great.

660
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:36,316
-What?
-It... it... it's nothing.

661
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,218
No, come on.

662
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,655
It's just really weird
to see you in real life.

663
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:42,489
Oh, you've been...

664
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,057
Nonstop every night.

665
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,861
It's crazy, man.

666
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:50,330
Wow. Well,
I hope I'm behaving.

667
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,334
Well, no, you're not.
No, not at all.

668
00:33:54,636 --> 00:33:56,103
Got Paul here.

669
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:58,405
-There you are.
-Here I am.

670
00:33:58,506 --> 00:34:00,307
Paul. Trent, hey.

671
00:34:00,407 --> 00:34:02,010
I have been dreaming
about this meeting.

672
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,177
-Aw, yeah, me, too.
-Really?

673
00:34:04,278 --> 00:34:06,380
Oh, you mean
literally dreaming?

674
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,482
You know, I've
actually had dreams
about this very meeting.

675
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,484
I mean, I just think
they were just normal dreams.

676
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:13,721
Not part of the whole,
who's this weird guy
in my dreams?

677
00:34:13,821 --> 00:34:15,990
Oh, uh... I'm weird?

678
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,560
No, I mean, you're not weird.
No, the whole thing
is weird, right?

679
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,761
I mean, Molly's dreams
have been nuts...

680
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:21,428
-Trent!
If you wanna
talk about weird.

681
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:23,330
But this is my colleague,
Mary Wiggins.

682
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,700
-Hi.
-Hi, Paul.

683
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,834
Sit down.

684
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:28,335
-Here?
-Wherever you want.

685
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:29,403
Yeah.

686
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:32,072
How are you? How's life?

687
00:34:32,172 --> 00:34:36,276
Well, uh, things
have been pretty different

688
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,445
since, you know...
since the dreams started.

689
00:34:38,546 --> 00:34:39,681
How fun is that?

690
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:42,016
I mean, I wish I was the one
people were dreaming about.

691
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:43,216
-Me, too.
-Yeah.

692
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:45,419
No, it's... it's something.

693
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,488
Well, we're... we're just
so excited to have you here.

694
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,157
Oh, yeah,
we're really fired up.

695
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:51,893
Um, it's probably
really overwhelming,

696
00:34:51,993 --> 00:34:53,327
right, to walk
into a room like this.

697
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,762
It's like,
"Who are these people?

698
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:55,964
What am I doing here?"

699
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,398
Maybe we should back up
and just talk about what we do.

700
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:00,935
Yeah, yeah, so, we started
Thoughts earlier this year,

701
00:35:01,035 --> 00:35:02,537
-so we're a pretty
new agency.
-Ah.

702
00:35:02,637 --> 00:35:04,706
And we focus
mostly online,

703
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,842
sort of trying
to holistically pair brands

704
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:11,111
and more, shall we say,
unconventional celebrities,

705
00:35:11,211 --> 00:35:12,479
if that makes sense?

706
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,817
And I think of you,
right now, in this moment,

707
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:19,887
Paul, as the most interesting
person in the world.

708
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,188
What?

709
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,322
I mean it, I mean it.

710
00:35:22,422 --> 00:35:23,591
No, we don't
just throw that around.

711
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,927
No, we really
don't throw that around.

712
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:28,096
I mean, the advantage
that you have, Paul,

713
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,932
is that your impact is...
is not just tied

714
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:32,567
to any one social arena.

715
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,602
I mean, you're not just famous
for people on TikTok

716
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:37,071
or for people who read,
say, the New Yorker,

717
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,407
you're in people's minds
when they sleep.

718
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:43,310
Which means
that anyone who's dreaming,

719
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,212
you know,
could be your audience.

720
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,714
How amazing is that?

721
00:35:46,814 --> 00:35:47,782
Who can say that?

722
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,818
You know,
is that a big enough audience?

723
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:52,086
Yeah.

724
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:53,220
So, you know,
we've been brainstorming

725
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,488
a bunch of cool ideas

726
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,156
that we want
to talk about with you.

727
00:35:56,256 --> 00:35:57,592
But before
we get into any of that,

728
00:35:57,692 --> 00:35:59,727
we were just kind of curious
what you're thinking, you know,

729
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,729
where do you wanna go,
what do you want to achieve?

730
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,698
-What are your dreams?
-What are <i>your</i> dreams?

731
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:06,768
Well, I've been meaning
to write a book

732
00:36:06,868 --> 00:36:08,368
for a few years now.

733
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,138
Just never found
the time, so...

734
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:11,773
Okay, so, you're a writer?

735
00:36:11,873 --> 00:36:13,306
That's awesome.

736
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,677
You know, we...
we talked about selling

737
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:17,545
your life rights to
a movie studio, actually.

738
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,446
Oh, because with
all the buzz around this,

739
00:36:19,547 --> 00:36:21,916
I think we could probably
get a six-figure deal.

740
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,216
And that's just life rights.

741
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:24,519
-Really?
-Yeah.

742
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:25,987
-Life rights?
-Yeah.

743
00:36:26,087 --> 00:36:27,387
The rights to your life.

744
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:29,657
Anyway,
here's somewhere cool

745
00:36:29,757 --> 00:36:32,426
that we thought might be
a good place to start.

746
00:36:33,795 --> 00:36:34,829
Sprite.

747
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,229
Sprite.

748
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,464
-Sprite?
-Yeah.

749
00:36:37,565 --> 00:36:39,767
Yeah. They... they want us
to run their social.

750
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:42,003
I think somebody over there
must have lost their minds

751
00:36:42,103 --> 00:36:43,336
or something,
but they're down

752
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:44,539
to go pretty weird with it.

753
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,406
So, we thought
it could be fun

754
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:48,676
if maybe they, like,
Tweet a new photo of you

755
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:50,343
every night holding a can,
you know,

756
00:36:50,444 --> 00:36:51,612
with a fun little caption,

757
00:36:51,713 --> 00:36:53,715
just to really manifest
that connection

758
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:55,750
in people's minds
and to hopefully alter

759
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,652
the phenomenon,
at least temporarily,

760
00:36:57,752 --> 00:37:01,388
to make people
dream about you
and the product together.

761
00:37:01,488 --> 00:37:03,490
How amazing
would that be, right?

762
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:05,193
And if we couldn't
figure that out,

763
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:08,062
we could always just
suggest that it did work

764
00:37:08,162 --> 00:37:09,396
and we could build stories
around that.

765
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:10,598
Yeah.
Absolutely.

766
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,166
I mean, if we fail
altogether, then we...

767
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:13,467
that's kind of
a fun story, too.

768
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:15,268
You know, like,
we tried to make people dream

769
00:37:15,368 --> 00:37:17,171
about Sprite
and it didn't work.

770
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,539
-I mean, it's so dumb...
-I love that.

771
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,775
...that it's kind of cool,
you know, it kind of works.

772
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,176
-Can I just...
-Yeah.

773
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,212
Can we go back to the book?

774
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:25,913
-What book?
-My book.

775
00:37:26,013 --> 00:37:27,181
The book I wanna write?

776
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,549
I just want to make it clear

777
00:37:28,649 --> 00:37:31,318
that I actually don't want
this whole phenomenon

778
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:32,520
to be what I'm known for.

779
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,522
I don't want that
to be the main thing

780
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,356
on my Wikipedia, you know?

781
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:41,095
Okay.
So, what are you thinking?

782
00:37:41,195 --> 00:37:43,263
Well, I'm an
evolutionary biologist.

783
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:44,832
That's what
I've dedicated my life to.

784
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,635
So, whatever we do,
I want it to be related

785
00:37:47,735 --> 00:37:48,836
to my doctorate.

786
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:50,303
Wow. Wow.
Okay. See, I...

787
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:51,471
I didn't know
about that at all.

788
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:52,673
Well, you're famous
for the dreams, right?

789
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,407
I mean, that's... that's
why anyone's interested.

790
00:37:54,509 --> 00:37:56,144
So, it might be
a bit of a stretch

791
00:37:56,244 --> 00:37:57,879
to get you into
a totally different space.

792
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,547
Yeah.

793
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:03,450
I'm a tenured professor.
I'm already <i>in</i> the space.

794
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:05,653
Well, you know, just
to give us a point of contact

795
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:06,854
as to what
we're talking about,

796
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,090
who are some of the big names
that you like

797
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,224
-in that space?
-Yeah.

798
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:12,392
Well, there's a bunch,
Robert Sapolsky.

799
00:38:12,492 --> 00:38:14,195
His career
has been pretty admirable.

800
00:38:14,294 --> 00:38:15,563
Oh, is he, um...

801
00:38:17,098 --> 00:38:19,432
No, I don't think
I'm familiar with
him, actually.

802
00:38:19,534 --> 00:38:21,068
Herman Tig, maybe?

803
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,737
-Who?
-Herman Tig.

804
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,305
Yeah.
No, I know that name.

805
00:38:25,405 --> 00:38:26,707
-Oh, you do?
-Yeah.

806
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:28,910
Well, these are not
really celebrities, I suppose.

807
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:31,145
No, that's the point,
I don't care about fame.

808
00:38:31,245 --> 00:38:32,580
I just see this
as an opportunity

809
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,447
to get some recognition
for my work.

810
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:36,884
You know, one door
opening another door?

811
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:37,785
Yeah.
No, I get that.

812
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:39,120
You're talking
about an audience pivot,

813
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,288
which I think is very smart.

814
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:41,889
I just don't know
if you can pivot that hard

815
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:44,125
right now without
a significant drop-off.

816
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:45,526
I mean,
a book about what, plants?

817
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,995
Yeah, well, I'm not
really interested
in doing Sprite ads.

818
00:38:48,095 --> 00:38:50,131
No, no, no. Well, that's
just one example, though, Paul.

819
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:51,566
I mean, we have
a ton of ideas.

820
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:54,135
Oh, that is just
the very tip of the iceberg.

821
00:38:54,235 --> 00:38:55,269
We have so many ideas.

822
00:38:55,368 --> 00:38:57,538
Um, one idea we had was

823
00:38:57,638 --> 00:39:00,641
to make Obama
dream about you.

824
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:03,410
That would get you into some
of those high-culture spaces

825
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:04,879
you've been mentioning.

826
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:07,915
I know Malia,
so we can make it happen.

827
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:10,151
Maybe this isn't
really what I'm looking for.

828
00:39:10,251 --> 00:39:11,351
I don't think
we're really speaking

829
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:13,087
-the same language here.
-No, Paul.

830
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,890
If that's how you're feeling,
then I'm failing, okay?

831
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,626
Can we just can... can...
can I... can we start over?

832
00:39:46,888 --> 00:39:49,323
I just thought you guys
could help me find a publisher.

833
00:39:49,422 --> 00:39:50,423
-I... I... I...
-First off,

834
00:39:50,524 --> 00:39:51,759
I would like to apologize.

835
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:55,495
I lied earlier.
I never dreamt about you.

836
00:39:55,596 --> 00:39:57,231
I just thought
that would be a fun way

837
00:39:57,331 --> 00:39:58,332
to start the meeting, okay?

838
00:39:58,431 --> 00:39:59,567
But what is absolutely true

839
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,770
is that I have been thinking
about you a lot

840
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,739
and I just really feel
that we're gonna do

841
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,574
something
very special together.

842
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:09,243
So let's just say
we go forward
with your plant book.

843
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:11,646
I never said anything
about plants.

844
00:40:11,746 --> 00:40:14,949
Oh, no. Your... your book
about evolutionary...

845
00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:16,918
-Plants.
-It's about ants.

846
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:18,219
-Ants.
-Ants.

847
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,787
-Oh. Oh.
-Okay, great.

848
00:40:19,887 --> 00:40:22,023
Well, let's say
we go forward with that.

849
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:23,257
We'll help you set that up.

850
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:25,359
-Really?
-Yes. I just...

851
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:26,894
I really wanna
work with you, Paul.

852
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:28,663
I mean, like I said,

853
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:30,798
most interesting person
in the world.

854
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,603
Okay, but then no ads,
no Sprite.

855
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,104
We're focusing on the book.

856
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,740
Yes, and, you know,

857
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:42,843
if you're not feeling Sprite,
we'll respect that.

858
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,879
I would just ask in return
that you hear out

859
00:40:44,979 --> 00:40:47,181
our pitches and just keep
an open mind, you know,

860
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,383
especially with things
like Sprite because, you know,

861
00:40:49,482 --> 00:40:50,685
the door is kind
of wide open there...

862
00:40:50,785 --> 00:40:51,919
-Yeah.
-...right now.

863
00:40:52,019 --> 00:40:53,254
And they're...
they're ready to have

864
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:54,288
that conversation with you.

865
00:40:54,388 --> 00:40:55,756
And that door closes,
I'll just say.

866
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,730
Yeah, okay.

867
00:41:04,332 --> 00:41:06,466
So, plans for the night?

868
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:10,204
Oh, no, I've got a really
early flight back, so...

869
00:41:15,576 --> 00:41:17,578
If you want to get a drink,
just let me know.

870
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:19,814
I can come near you,
if that's easier.

871
00:41:19,914 --> 00:41:21,415
They have you
at the Ace, right?

872
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:23,150
They were so great.

873
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,585
They really know their stuff.

874
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:26,520
They're gonna set me up
with a publisher

875
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,955
and get the book rolling.

876
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,423
<i>Wow, that's great!</i>

877
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:30,925
<i>Now you just have to write it.</i>

878
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,294
Yeah, of course.

879
00:41:33,394 --> 00:41:34,528
<i>So, what did they say?</i>

880
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:37,098
They called me
the most interesting person

881
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:38,699
in the world right now.

882
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:41,268
<i>Aw.</i>

883
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:42,737
-What?
-<i>No, nothing.</i>

884
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:44,305
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>that's very flattering.</i>

885
00:41:44,405 --> 00:41:45,639
No, they specifically said

886
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,441
they didn't
just throw that around.

887
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:48,876
<i>Okay.</i>

888
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:50,711
I don't think they were
just saying it

889
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:52,013
to make me feel good,
Janet,

890
00:41:52,113 --> 00:41:54,148
they're already talking
to big clients

891
00:41:54,248 --> 00:41:55,516
who want to work
with me.

892
00:41:55,616 --> 00:41:57,184
<i>Like who?</i>

893
00:41:57,284 --> 00:42:00,488
Like, I mean... well,
and this is just one example,

894
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:02,757
but they mentioned Sprite.

895
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:05,960
<i>Sprite? You're gonna work</i>
<i>with Sprite?</i>

896
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,862
-<i>Janet.</i>
<i>-I'll be right there.</i>

897
00:42:07,962 --> 00:42:08,896
Who's there?

898
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,197
<i>Chris.</i>

899
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:11,766
<i>Our deadline is tomorrow,</i>

900
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:13,167
<i>so we're just here</i>
<i>finishing up.</i>

901
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,269
Right.

902
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,437
Where are the kids?

903
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,172
<i>They're out</i>
<i>trick or treating with Kyle.</i>

904
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:20,374
Oh, Kyle.

905
00:42:20,474 --> 00:42:21,876
Okay.

906
00:42:21,976 --> 00:42:24,879
<i>Yeah, well, congrats, Paul,</i>

907
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,414
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, then.</i>

908
00:42:26,515 --> 00:42:27,815
Yeah, okay.

909
00:42:27,915 --> 00:42:29,550
Well, they... they also talked
about Obama, too,

910
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,619
like maybe
he'll dream about me.

911
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,187
<i>Okay.</i>

912
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:36,525
<i>I... I'm just saying</i>
<i>it wasn't just Sprite.</i>

913
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:38,125
<i>You don't</i>
<i>have to impress me, Paul.</i>

914
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:40,761
<i>-I love you.</i>
<i><i>-I love you, too.</i>

915
00:42:40,861 --> 00:42:43,397
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

916
00:42:43,497 --> 00:42:45,166
<i>Yeah. Bye.</i>

917
00:42:50,638 --> 00:42:51,906
Did you read
that article about people

918
00:42:52,006 --> 00:42:53,808
dreaming backward in Australia?

919
00:42:53,908 --> 00:42:55,376
-No.
-It's 'cause of, like,

920
00:42:55,476 --> 00:42:56,911
the gravitational pull
or something.

921
00:42:57,011 --> 00:42:58,679
They mentioned
you in it, so...

922
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:00,481
How do they dream
in China, then?

923
00:43:00,581 --> 00:43:02,817
Upside down?

924
00:43:04,785 --> 00:43:06,887
So, how long
have you been a professor?

925
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:12,493
Oh, wow. I think, what,
about 20 years, since '96.

926
00:43:12,593 --> 00:43:14,428
I was born in '96.

927
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:15,830
Check, please!

928
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,532
No, no, I'm kidding.

929
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,234
Like... like... like,
you're too young for me.

930
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:23,237
-Aren't you married?
-No, I wasn't implying...

931
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:24,573
It's a joke.

932
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:26,474
Yeah, no, I mean, I get it.

933
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:28,442
Oh, okay.

934
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:30,344
But yeah,
I... I am married.

935
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:32,279
-How about you?
-No.

936
00:43:32,379 --> 00:43:34,682
I'm not really, like,
seeing anyone or anything.

937
00:43:34,782 --> 00:43:36,317
I'm, like, focusing
on my career right now.

938
00:43:36,417 --> 00:43:37,384
-You know?
-Yeah.

939
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:38,752
You mean with the agency?

940
00:43:38,853 --> 00:43:40,855
You hated it so much,
didn't you?

941
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:44,725
No, it's just,
it kind of felt like...

942
00:43:45,192 --> 00:43:46,260
Like a cult.

943
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,462
Yeah. Sort of.

944
00:43:48,563 --> 00:43:50,599
I mean, I tried
telling them, like,

945
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:52,500
"He's a super
smart professor.

946
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:54,235
"Like, he's gonna
see through the bullshit."

947
00:43:54,335 --> 00:43:58,573
But honestly, though,
like, the Sprite thing is cool.

948
00:43:58,672 --> 00:43:59,974
-You should do it.
-Yeah?

949
00:44:00,074 --> 00:44:01,876
-Yeah.
-I'm struggling to imagine

950
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:05,179
anyone seeing my face and
immediately craving a Sprite.

951
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:06,280
I would.

952
00:44:13,254 --> 00:44:14,455
Can I ask you something?

953
00:44:14,556 --> 00:44:15,856
Yeah, what?

954
00:44:15,956 --> 00:44:17,925
I felt like
you implied something

955
00:44:18,025 --> 00:44:20,728
earlier about your dreams.

956
00:44:21,596 --> 00:44:22,730
It's embarrassing.

957
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:25,299
What, do I...
do I act weird or something?

958
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:26,901
I don't know if I should say.

959
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,370
Well, it's just dreams,
I won't judge.

960
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:32,306
You don't really get
to decide what happens, so...

961
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:34,275
Um, well, um...

962
00:44:35,577 --> 00:44:36,810
we fuck.

963
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:38,746
Really?

964
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:42,783
I have the most
intense sex dreams.

965
00:44:42,883 --> 00:44:46,287
Usually, I'm, like,
home and it's late

966
00:44:46,387 --> 00:44:49,456
<i>and I'm alone and I'm,</i>
<i>like, watching TV or something.</i>

967
00:44:49,558 --> 00:44:50,791
<i>And then...</i>

968
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:55,396
Is someone there?

969
00:44:59,668 --> 00:45:00,901
Who are you?

970
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,907
Hello?

971
00:45:13,147 --> 00:45:14,114
Who are you?

972
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:17,151
How did you get in here?

973
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:24,024
Please don't hurt me.

974
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:35,102
I'm so wet.

975
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:40,941
I'm sorry, I've had,
like, one drink

976
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:43,077
and I'm, like, no filter.

977
00:45:43,177 --> 00:45:45,112
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

978
00:45:45,212 --> 00:45:46,780
No, it's so
graphic, I'm sorry.

979
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,982
I'm glad you told me.

980
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:49,684
Usually,
what I hear is I'm just

981
00:45:49,783 --> 00:45:51,352
passively hanging around.

982
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:53,921
It's kind of nice
to hear I'm doing something.

983
00:45:54,021 --> 00:45:55,122
Well, I guess I'm lucky.

984
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:56,625
Well, I don't know about that.

985
00:45:56,725 --> 00:46:00,227
No, it's so good. Trust me.

986
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:03,831
Do you want another drink?
I need another drink.

987
00:46:03,931 --> 00:46:05,266
-Martini, right?
-Dirty.

988
00:46:13,073 --> 00:46:14,808
Can I... can I get
another cabernet and...

989
00:46:14,908 --> 00:46:16,511
and one martini, please?

990
00:46:28,355 --> 00:46:30,157
And that's
the thing with the zebras.

991
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:32,826
The camouflage is for blending
in with the herd

992
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:35,396
because the lion can't just
hunt the whole group.

993
00:46:35,496 --> 00:46:38,533
It has to identify
a single target, right?

994
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,100
What?

995
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,604
Sorry,
but those people
are staring at us.

996
00:46:42,704 --> 00:46:43,871
I mean, at you, obviously.

997
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,205
Jesus, should we not be here,

998
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:47,007
-maybe, or should we just...
-Why? What's wrong?

999
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,842
No, I mean...
I just...

1000
00:46:48,942 --> 00:46:51,178
I don't want any rumors
if I'm meeting with Obama.

1001
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:53,548
-What do you mean?
-No, I mean,

1002
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:56,016
I... I'm not used to this.

1003
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:58,185
-Should we, um...
-What?

1004
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,355
I can't get it out
of my head and I'm, like,

1005
00:47:01,455 --> 00:47:03,257
here with you and,
like, fuck it, okay.

1006
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:05,459
Can you do me a favor?

1007
00:47:34,288 --> 00:47:36,223
Yeah,
so, this is me.

1008
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:45,533
It's nice.
Small and nice.

1009
00:47:45,633 --> 00:47:47,669
Yeah, well, I don't
have rich parents, so...

1010
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:49,370
No, it wasn't a jab.

1011
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,904
I mean, it's cozy.

1012
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:53,073
You've done a good job.

1013
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:57,211
Sit down.

1014
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:17,097
-So...
-So... This is insane.

1015
00:48:17,197 --> 00:48:20,234
You have no fucking idea
how crazy this is to me.

1016
00:48:20,334 --> 00:48:23,203
-I shouldn't even be here.
-No, don't leave.

1017
00:48:23,303 --> 00:48:25,807
I... I think I'm a bit drunk.

1018
00:48:25,906 --> 00:48:27,107
Me, too. Just stay.

1019
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:29,209
You just got here,
just stay for a second.

1020
00:48:34,915 --> 00:48:36,283
Is that a fixed gear?

1021
00:48:37,184 --> 00:48:41,121
No, it's, uh,
like, a regular one.

1022
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:48,028
So, how do we do this?

1023
00:48:48,429 --> 00:48:49,631
Oh, um...

1024
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:54,134
I feel like
I want to change first.

1025
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:56,571
-Is that cool?
-Sure.

1026
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:58,972
Okay. Okay, two seconds.

1027
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:35,242
Everything good?

1028
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:38,613
Yeah.

1029
00:49:38,713 --> 00:49:44,017
Um, so, where do you want me?

1030
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,521
Could you remove your jacket?

1031
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,324
Sure.

1032
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:57,599
Okay, now, would you stand
in that corner over there?

1033
00:49:58,867 --> 00:50:00,434
-Over there?
-Yeah.

1034
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:14,516
Get all the way
up against the wall.

1035
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,642
-Okay, so, did that work for...
-Sorry, shut up.

1036
00:50:40,742 --> 00:50:44,044
Just... can you just...
can you just go on
a little more?

1037
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:47,015
Just, you know,
I'm... I'm married.

1038
00:50:47,114 --> 00:50:48,583
I know, we can stop
any time you like.

1039
00:50:48,683 --> 00:50:51,251
Just please let me just...
a little longer.

1040
00:50:54,822 --> 00:50:57,291
This time, please don't speak.
Just do the dream.

1041
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:15,108
Who are you?

1042
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,215
Please don't hurt me.

1043
00:51:30,658 --> 00:51:31,693
Touch me.

1044
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:44,471
What?

1045
00:51:44,572 --> 00:51:47,909
It's just...
in the dreams you, like...

1046
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:49,544
you usually take the lead.

1047
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,411
Yeah.

1048
00:51:52,145 --> 00:51:53,548
What do you want?

1049
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:10,665
Oh.

1050
00:52:11,866 --> 00:52:14,234
I'm sorry.
It's just nerves.

1051
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:16,504
It's okay.
Don't worry.

1052
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:19,172
-The body sometimes...
-Yeah. It's fine.

1053
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:20,842
Biologically speaking,
it's actually quite...

1054
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:23,711
-It's... it's fine. Relax.
-It's... it's healthy.

1055
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:26,213
-Okay.
-Okay.

1056
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:58,178
Did you just come?

1057
00:54:54,996 --> 00:54:56,030
Fuck!

1058
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:58,465
Fuck!

1059
00:54:59,667 --> 00:55:00,668
Fuck.

1060
00:55:01,836 --> 00:55:03,336
Fuck.

1061
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:06,974
Yeah, you fuck!

1062
00:55:11,746 --> 00:55:13,413
Fuck!

1063
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:23,691
Professor, what's going on?

1064
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:26,359
-Can I come in?
-Why?

1065
00:55:26,459 --> 00:55:28,830
-I need help with something.
-Okay.

1066
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:33,935
-What?
I don't
want to stand here

1067
00:55:34,035 --> 00:55:35,435
in the hallway and explain.

1068
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:37,370
Well, can it wait?
I'm in the middle
of something.

1069
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:38,773
Just five minutes.

1070
00:55:39,941 --> 00:55:41,309
I'll come out.

1071
00:55:41,408 --> 00:55:43,443
Would be better
if we sat down.

1072
00:55:58,192 --> 00:55:59,760
What's... what's going on?

1073
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:04,497
-That was a mistake.
-What do you mean?

1074
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,399
What just happened,
that was a mistake.

1075
00:56:08,435 --> 00:56:09,670
You shouldn't have done that.

1076
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,739
I don't understand.

1077
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:13,808
You're just so
fucking stupid sometimes.

1078
00:56:13,908 --> 00:56:17,511
Do you know that?
Have you heard that before?

1079
00:56:20,948 --> 00:56:22,250
Okay. Okay.

1080
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,684
Please leave.

1081
00:57:06,127 --> 00:57:07,094
Where is everyone?

1082
00:57:07,662 --> 00:57:09,096
I'm not really sure.

1083
00:57:11,532 --> 00:57:14,535
-I'm shocked.
-Yeah, and they got worse.

1084
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:17,138
Some are even
sexual in nature,

1085
00:57:17,238 --> 00:57:20,808
so they don't feel
comfortable being in
your class right now.

1086
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:23,411
Jesus, they had
some bad dreams

1087
00:57:23,511 --> 00:57:25,680
and now they're not gonna
show up for class?

1088
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:28,015
I mean,
we can't just accept that.

1089
00:57:28,115 --> 00:57:30,718
I don't know what to do here.
 I mean, obviously,

1090
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:33,486
I have to take the students'
concerns seriously, too.

1091
00:57:33,587 --> 00:57:34,822
Well, yes, of course.

1092
00:57:34,922 --> 00:57:38,292
But isn't this a bit
of an overreaction?

1093
00:57:38,392 --> 00:57:39,961
They're dreams.
It's not real.

1094
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:42,697
I'm not actually
doing anything to them.

1095
00:57:42,797 --> 00:57:45,099
As I said before,
this is new territory.

1096
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:48,501
Um, I think I just need
to consult with HR.

1097
00:57:52,606 --> 00:57:54,875
Do you, Brett, as my friend,

1098
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:57,345
and not speaking as
the Dean of Osler,

1099
00:57:57,445 --> 00:57:58,913
think that
we should pause this semester

1100
00:57:59,013 --> 00:58:01,481
because some students
are having bad dreams?

1101
00:58:01,582 --> 00:58:03,617
Well, I haven't had one
of these dreams,

1102
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:05,019
so I can't speak to the...

1103
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:07,989
No, no, no,
don't say lived experience.

1104
00:58:08,089 --> 00:58:10,558
But it sounds like they've
actually been traumatized.

1105
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:12,827
Trauma is a trend these days.

1106
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:15,329
It is a joke.
Everything is trauma.

1107
00:58:15,429 --> 00:58:16,797
Arguing with a friend
is trauma,

1108
00:58:16,897 --> 00:58:18,432
getting bad grades is trauma.

1109
00:58:18,532 --> 00:58:20,267
They need to grow up.

1110
00:58:24,572 --> 00:58:27,608
-Hi.
-Richard, it's been too long.

1111
00:58:28,676 --> 00:58:30,478
Are we the first ones?

1112
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:33,214
Uh, actually,
it's... it'll just be us.

1113
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:35,549
Really? I thought this was
gonna be one of your famous

1114
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:37,184
bring-people-together things.

1115
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:40,521
Uh, we thought it'd be nicer,
just us four.

1116
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:44,158
Okay, yeah. More wine for us.

1117
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:51,232
-Cheers, guys.
-Cheers.

1118
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:59,640
So, Carlota, I heard you're
at a new practice now.

1119
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:03,110
-Yeah, I am.
-Yeah?

1120
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:05,980
Yes.

1121
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:12,987
This is so good, by the way.

1122
00:59:13,087 --> 00:59:15,524
Oh, my gosh, these Brussels
sprouts are amazing.

1123
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:17,892
Yeah, we got them at, uh...

1124
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:22,229
-Shelly's.
-Ah.

1125
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,837
So, I'm starting to think that
maybe Nick Bostrum was right

1126
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:31,739
about the simulation theory.

1127
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,408
That would sure explain
a lot about my situation.

1128
00:59:34,509 --> 00:59:36,744
Yeah, remember
Nick, Carlota?

1129
00:59:36,844 --> 00:59:39,548
Swedish guy,
philosopher at Oxford.

1130
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,715
-He was here?
-Yeah, once or twice.

1131
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:43,851
You should invite us
both next time.

1132
00:59:43,951 --> 00:59:46,555
He'd probably love
to speak with me.

1133
00:59:46,654 --> 00:59:49,323
Wasn't I even the one
who told you about him?

1134
00:59:50,191 --> 00:59:51,959
No, I don't think so.

1135
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:00,535
Carlota, are you still
doing your pottery?

1136
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:06,541
Ah.

1137
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,109
-Oh, don't be so rough.
-What?

1138
01:00:08,209 --> 01:00:09,743
You're slamming my back.

1139
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:14,148
-Sorry.
-Is... is everything good?

1140
01:00:14,248 --> 01:00:17,618
She had a... a rough day
at work today.

1141
01:00:17,718 --> 01:00:19,086
-Ah.
-So...

1142
01:00:19,186 --> 01:00:20,354
Okay.

1143
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,662
Oh, no. What's the matter?

1144
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:32,867
Sorry, can't do this.
I can't.

1145
01:00:39,574 --> 01:00:41,208
What the hell is going on?

1146
01:00:41,308 --> 01:00:42,676
I have no idea.

1147
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:48,082
-Richard.
-Richard, what's wrong?

1148
01:00:48,182 --> 01:00:52,219
Uh, guys, uh... I think we're
gonna have to wrap this up.

1149
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,121
Carlota isn't feeling well.

1150
01:00:54,221 --> 01:00:57,491
Oh, no. Is she ill?

1151
01:00:57,592 --> 01:01:01,695
It... It's you, Paul.

1152
01:01:02,897 --> 01:01:06,934
She's had some pretty brutal
nightmares lately.

1153
01:01:07,034 --> 01:01:11,172
Oh, wow. I just couldn't...

1154
01:01:11,272 --> 01:01:13,642
I'm so sorry,
you could have told us.

1155
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:15,644
I convinced her not to cancel.

1156
01:01:15,743 --> 01:01:18,279
I shouldn't have done that.

1157
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:21,115
Well, shouldn't
the three of us
still finish, though?

1158
01:01:21,215 --> 01:01:25,019
-It'd be a waste to just...
-No, you... you have to leave.

1159
01:01:26,153 --> 01:01:28,956
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

1160
01:01:29,056 --> 01:01:31,258
Why do you think
no one else is here?

1161
01:01:35,496 --> 01:01:39,767
The basic idea
with cognitive
behavioral therapy

1162
01:01:39,867 --> 01:01:43,070
is that we'll go through
gradual exposure

1163
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,072
to what we feel
is threatening us

1164
01:01:45,172 --> 01:01:48,242
to familiarize with it,
instead of fearing it.

1165
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:51,045
What doesn't kill us makes us
stronger, right?

1166
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:54,148
I know a lot of you have had

1167
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:56,383
very upsetting dreams
about your professor.

1168
01:01:58,786 --> 01:02:01,455
These dreams suggest
that Paul Matthews

1169
01:02:01,556 --> 01:02:03,057
is a harmful person.

1170
01:02:04,191 --> 01:02:06,528
So, your mind is trying
to protect you,

1171
01:02:06,628 --> 01:02:11,265
make you safe by creating
certain emotional triggers.

1172
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:14,134
Motivating you to avoid him.

1173
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:17,905
I want to diffuse
those triggers

1174
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,873
by showing you that Paul

1175
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:24,845
is, in fact, a kind, loving,
harmless human being.

1176
01:02:51,539 --> 01:02:57,044
Okay. I'm going to invite
Paul into the room.

1177
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,447
He's gonna step
inside that door,

1178
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:02,049
all the way over there

1179
01:03:02,149 --> 01:03:05,754
and he's gonna stay at
that safe distance

1180
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:08,289
until everybody
feels comfortable

1181
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:10,057
to invite him closer.

1182
01:03:10,157 --> 01:03:14,194
If anyone feels unsafe,
calmly state,

1183
01:03:14,295 --> 01:03:17,298
"Candice, I do not feel safe
in this moment."

1184
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:20,769
Does everybody understand that?

1185
01:03:20,868 --> 01:03:22,436
Yes.

1186
01:03:26,373 --> 01:03:29,043
All right. Paul!

1187
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:46,994
Okay. That wasn't
so bad, was it?

1188
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:49,798
Let's have him step forward.

1189
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:51,932
Come just a little bit closer.

1190
01:03:52,767 --> 01:03:54,101
Paul.

1191
01:04:06,748 --> 01:04:08,182
Paul isn't gonna hurt you.

1192
01:04:09,316 --> 01:04:11,418
Can we have him come just
a little bit closer?

1193
01:04:17,091 --> 01:04:19,059
Paul, step closer, please.

1194
01:04:33,842 --> 01:04:35,342
So...

1195
01:04:35,442 --> 01:04:36,611
Leah, wait.

1196
01:04:36,711 --> 01:04:38,513
Look what you did...

1197
01:05:15,517 --> 01:05:17,251
Hey! Hey!

1198
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:19,654
Who did this?

1199
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:22,489
Tell me now.

1200
01:05:23,957 --> 01:05:26,059
Stop being little
fucking brats.

1201
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,930
Who the fuck did this?

1202
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:34,435
-Fuck you, Matthews.
-Go home!

1203
01:05:34,536 --> 01:05:36,437
Why don't
you just quit, Paul?

1204
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:37,906
-Bye, Paul.
-Bye.

1205
01:05:38,005 --> 01:05:39,473
Bye.

1206
01:05:39,574 --> 01:05:41,275
So, what did Brett say?

1207
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,912
See it as
a little vacation.

1208
01:05:44,011 --> 01:05:46,046
Can you believe it?

1209
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:48,449
I'm a tenured professor
and they're basically

1210
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:51,084
just letting the students
run the school.

1211
01:05:51,185 --> 01:05:52,520
So, how long are you
not gonna be working?

1212
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:55,055
I don't even know if I want
to go back at this point.

1213
01:05:55,155 --> 01:05:57,357
I should just go all in
with the book.

1214
01:06:00,127 --> 01:06:02,429
So, like, what did you do?
Why did everything change?

1215
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,666
-I didn't do anything, Hannah.
-You must have done something.

1216
01:06:04,766 --> 01:06:08,402
-Well, I didn't, so...
-Have you seen Twitter?

1217
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:11,940
-No.
-It's like thousands of people

1218
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:13,373
sharing nightmares
about, like...

1219
01:06:13,474 --> 01:06:16,711
-like, torture and rape and...
-Enough, okay?

1220
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:18,847
New rule.

1221
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:25,085
No phones at the table and no
discussion of the dreams, okay?

1222
01:06:25,185 --> 01:06:27,087
I'm just saying, like,
I... I understand...

1223
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:28,890
Okay, you already broke
the rule, Hannah.

1224
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:30,525
So, let's just start over.

1225
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:35,730
No mention of this
at the table
ever again, please.

1226
01:06:39,466 --> 01:06:41,603
Are you gonna clean
that stuff off the car?

1227
01:06:44,304 --> 01:06:46,440
They're kicking me off
the project?

1228
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:50,143
I think that they
just want to be
extra careful moving into

1229
01:06:50,244 --> 01:06:53,548
the final stages, just as
a precautionary measure.

1230
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:56,016
Because of Paul?

1231
01:06:56,116 --> 01:06:58,318
Yeah. You know,
I'm against cancel culture

1232
01:06:58,418 --> 01:07:00,387
and all of that stuff,
I really am.

1233
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:04,124
But I think that just right
now maybe it would be best

1234
01:07:04,224 --> 01:07:07,327
if you kept a lower profile,
you know?

1235
01:07:07,427 --> 01:07:11,599
Just until the whole, like,
scandal situation blows over.

1236
01:07:14,234 --> 01:07:16,538
Does that make sense?

1237
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:24,746
They call you Freddy Krueger
at school.

1238
01:07:24,846 --> 01:07:27,682
Oh? Do you know who that is?

1239
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:29,283
I Googled it.

1240
01:07:29,383 --> 01:07:31,853
Yeah, they're just trying
to tease you.

1241
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:33,888
Julian said that you
tied him up

1242
01:07:33,988 --> 01:07:36,658
and cut his toes off
and ate them.

1243
01:07:36,758 --> 01:07:40,528
Do you think I would cut
someone's toes off?

1244
01:07:43,598 --> 01:07:44,832
No.

1245
01:07:51,606 --> 01:07:54,509
Dreaming is like
a psychosis, Sophie.

1246
01:07:54,609 --> 01:07:59,346
Our brain decides
to start hallucinating
while we sleep.

1247
01:07:59,446 --> 01:08:02,617
It's part of
its housekeeping process.

1248
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:06,688
We need that to happen,
for some reason.

1249
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,758
But why are you so mean
in the dreams?

1250
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:14,862
It's their dreams.
I have nothing to do with it.

1251
01:08:15,863 --> 01:08:18,131
You understand that, right?

1252
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,200
I guess.

1253
01:08:21,301 --> 01:08:23,470
I think I'm going to stay
home tomorrow.

1254
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:26,273
So, if you need me
to cook or something...

1255
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:30,712
-Who's Molly?
-What?

1256
01:08:30,812 --> 01:08:33,514
You have texts
from someone
named Molly?

1257
01:08:35,182 --> 01:08:37,885
Oh, she's the assistant
at the agency.

1258
01:08:37,986 --> 01:08:39,854
She's setting up a call.

1259
01:08:39,954 --> 01:08:41,488
Mm.

1260
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:43,524
You never mentioned her.

1261
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,304
Hey, it's Paul.

1262
01:08:58,606 --> 01:09:01,341
I... I was just
calling to say hi.

1263
01:09:04,211 --> 01:09:05,613
<i>Okay, we can</i>
<i>do it another time.</i>

1264
01:09:05,713 --> 01:09:08,916
<i>I just... just wanted</i>
<i>to catch up. Yep.</i>

1265
01:09:09,017 --> 01:09:10,652
<i>No worries.</i>
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1266
01:09:10,752 --> 01:09:12,185
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

1267
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:21,829
<i>Two seconds, Paul.</i>

1268
01:09:21,929 --> 01:09:23,731
<i>I'm just trying</i>
<i>to connect Mary to the call.</i>

1269
01:09:23,831 --> 01:09:25,533
Yeah, no problem.

1270
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,468
<i>-Hi, Paul.</i>
-Who's this?

1271
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:31,204
<i>It's Molly,</i>
<i>I'm just listening in.</i>

1272
01:09:32,205 --> 01:09:36,410
Hi, Molly. How are you?

1273
01:09:36,511 --> 01:09:38,211
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>Is everybody on?</i>

1274
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:39,747
I'm here, Trent.

1275
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:42,884
<i>-Hey, Mary, you on?</i>
<i>-Oh! Oh, Trent,</i>

1276
01:09:42,984 --> 01:09:45,053
<i>sorry, Mary just texted me</i>
<i>and she had the wrong link.</i>

1277
01:09:45,153 --> 01:09:47,522
Should we just start?

1278
01:09:47,622 --> 01:09:49,757
<i>-Um, yeah.</i>
<i>-Hello?</i>

1279
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:51,693
<i>-Hey, there you are.</i>
<i>-Can you guys hear me?</i>

1280
01:09:51,793 --> 01:09:54,294
<i>Yeah. Paul?</i>

1281
01:09:54,394 --> 01:09:57,565
Yeah, I can hear you.
What's going on, guys?

1282
01:09:57,665 --> 01:09:59,667
<i>Okay, hi.</i>
<i>What a crazy week, right?</i>

1283
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:02,570
<i>So, obviously, we have</i>
<i>to change strategies here</i>

1284
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,404
<i>to adapt</i>
<i>to the current situation.</i>

1285
01:10:04,505 --> 01:10:05,940
Is Obama still a thing?

1286
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,240
That might be
helpful now, right?

1287
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:08,643
<i>What?</i>

1288
01:10:08,743 --> 01:10:11,879
Obama, you said
you guys were
talking to Obama, right?

1289
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:15,650
<i>Oh, I'm... Obama is not</i>
<i>an option anymore, Paul.</i>

1290
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:17,484
<i>Yeah. No. So, Paul,</i>
<i>we're... we're talking about</i>

1291
01:10:17,585 --> 01:10:19,654
<i>a complete 180.</i>
<i>We have to think fresh.</i>

1292
01:10:19,754 --> 01:10:22,757
<i>Corporate culture won't</i>
<i>touch this. It's too risky.</i>

1293
01:10:22,857 --> 01:10:24,759
<i>Yeah, but we are</i>
<i>getting positive signals</i>

1294
01:10:24,859 --> 01:10:27,128
<i>from a different venue.</i>
<i>The whole,</i>

1295
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:28,596
<i>I don't wanna say alt-right,</i>

1296
01:10:28,696 --> 01:10:30,898
<i>but the kind of</i>
<i>anti-establishment space,</i>

1297
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:33,034
<i>you know, kind of</i>
<i>the Jordan Peterson route.</i>

1298
01:10:33,134 --> 01:10:35,837
<i>Yeah, we can</i>
<i>maybe get you on</i>
<i>Rogan or something.</i>

1299
01:10:35,937 --> 01:10:39,040
<i>Share your experience of being</i>
<i>cancelled and just, like,</i>

1300
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,308
<i>pivot that combo</i>
<i>to the plant book.</i>

1301
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:44,812
Guys, no. I hate that idea.

1302
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:47,715
<i>Uh-huh. So, just so</i>
<i>we can understand you better,</i>

1303
01:10:47,815 --> 01:10:49,483
<i>what exactly</i>
<i>are you opposed to?</i>

1304
01:10:49,584 --> 01:10:52,285
I don't wanna be some
culture war person.

1305
01:10:52,385 --> 01:10:56,190
I... I... I don't
want to be
controversial.

1306
01:10:56,289 --> 01:10:57,859
<i>Okay. Well, yeah,</i>

1307
01:10:57,959 --> 01:11:00,561
<i>this is gonna go</i>
<i>right against what</i>
<i>you're saying right now.</i>

1308
01:11:00,661 --> 01:11:02,530
<i>But there is a chance,</i>
<i>we think, to get you</i>

1309
01:11:02,630 --> 01:11:04,165
<i>-on Tucker Carlson</i>
<i>this week...</i>
<i>Tucker.</i>

1310
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:05,833
<i>So, that's a big audience.</i>

1311
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:07,400
<i>Just think about that.</i>
<i>Don't answer right now.</i>

1312
01:11:07,501 --> 01:11:10,204
<i>And then also,</i>
<i>there's France, Paul.</i>

1313
01:11:10,303 --> 01:11:11,906
<i>For some reason,</i>
<i>they love you over there.</i>

1314
01:11:12,006 --> 01:11:13,908
<i>Even with the nightmares,</i>
<i>they love it.</i>

1315
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,843
<i>Yeah. You're building</i>
<i>a fanbase over there.</i>

1316
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:19,346
Isn't there some type
of charity I can do, maybe?

1317
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:21,115
<i>No, that's sweet.</i>
<i>But no.</i>

1318
01:11:21,215 --> 01:11:22,950
<i>It might seem apologetic.</i>

1319
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:33,393
-Hi.
-It's good, thanks.

1320
01:11:36,296 --> 01:11:38,331
-What?
-I'm so sorry, sir.

1321
01:11:38,431 --> 01:11:40,935
I hate to do this,
but there are
some people that

1322
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:43,571
aren't really that
comfortable with
the fact that you're here.

1323
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:49,677
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1324
01:11:49,777 --> 01:11:51,112
Well, if they're
so uncomfortable,

1325
01:11:51,212 --> 01:11:52,680
maybe they should leave.

1326
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:54,215
Um, yeah, but...

1327
01:11:54,314 --> 01:11:55,550
I'm just enjoying my meal.

1328
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:57,151
I haven't said
or done anything.

1329
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:59,419
Right. I mean,
I guess I could tell them

1330
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,789
-you're about to leave, or...
-Why should I leave?

1331
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:04,225
I haven't broken any
of your rules, have I?

1332
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:05,927
-I mean, no.
-Well, great.

1333
01:12:06,027 --> 01:12:09,931
-Then that's that.
-Uh, yeah, I guess.

1334
01:12:10,031 --> 01:12:11,431
Okay.

1335
01:12:22,143 --> 01:12:24,879
Hey, hi.

1336
01:12:24,979 --> 01:12:27,715
Would you do us a favor
and just wrap that up?

1337
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:29,984
Nobody wants
you here, man.

1338
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:32,653
Well, I'm staying.

1339
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:34,722
Are you sure
about that?
-Yeah, I'm going to enjoy

1340
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:37,725
my food and leave
when I'm done, okay?

1341
01:12:38,993 --> 01:12:39,961
Okay.

1342
01:13:26,374 --> 01:13:29,644
Listen,
maybe you need to be
more proactive about this.

1343
01:13:30,311 --> 01:13:32,513
What do you mean?

1344
01:13:32,613 --> 01:13:36,183
Make a public statement
or something?

1345
01:13:36,284 --> 01:13:39,287
-Maybe you should apologize.
-I should apologize?

1346
01:13:39,387 --> 01:13:41,756
Take a look at my face
for Christ's sake.

1347
01:13:41,856 --> 01:13:45,026
Well, just to get people off
your back... off our backs.

1348
01:13:45,126 --> 01:13:47,460
No, that's ridiculous.
I'm not gonna do that.

1349
01:13:47,561 --> 01:13:50,298
You're not alone in this.
I almost lost my job.

1350
01:13:50,398 --> 01:13:53,567
Which is completely
uncalled for.

1351
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:55,937
Sophie is being picked on
at school.

1352
01:13:56,037 --> 01:13:57,872
Hannah is depressed.

1353
01:13:57,972 --> 01:14:00,908
We get weird phone calls
in the middle of the night.

1354
01:14:01,008 --> 01:14:03,010
Someone... someone
broke into our house.

1355
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:05,713
So, we're just gonna let
the terrorists win?

1356
01:14:05,813 --> 01:14:08,649
Who's to say
anything will be
different if I do apologize?

1357
01:14:08,749 --> 01:14:10,351
Oh, so, basically,
you're just choosing for us

1358
01:14:10,450 --> 01:14:11,385
to be more miserable.

1359
01:14:11,484 --> 01:14:13,621
Would you...
would you fucking stop?

1360
01:14:28,736 --> 01:14:29,937
Hey!

1361
01:17:00,421 --> 01:17:03,991
It seems like
there's consensus
amongst the parents,

1362
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:06,595
and if it's not
too much to ask,

1363
01:17:06,727 --> 01:17:08,729
we'd like you
to sit this one out.

1364
01:17:08,829 --> 01:17:11,165
But it is,
it is too much to ask.

1365
01:17:11,265 --> 01:17:14,068
It's ridiculous.
This is a huge moment for her.

1366
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:15,669
Of course,
I'm going to be there.

1367
01:17:15,769 --> 01:17:16,937
-Paul, please.
-What?

1368
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:18,372
They're imposing an exile.

1369
01:17:18,472 --> 01:17:19,440
Am I supposed
to just accept that?

1370
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:20,774
Don't be so dramatic.

1371
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:21,742
We'll get someone
to record it, okay?

1372
01:17:21,842 --> 01:17:23,077
You'll... Um,
you'll get to see it.

1373
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:25,679
Just not in the room
on the night.

1374
01:17:27,248 --> 01:17:29,250
You're aware that
I have a Ph.D., right?

1375
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:32,953
-Yes.
-And you, B.A.?

1376
01:17:33,053 --> 01:17:35,055
-M.A.
-What I'm saying is,

1377
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:37,592
I don't need
your opinions on pedagogy.

1378
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:39,528
Okay, I understand
that you want to be there.

1379
01:17:39,628 --> 01:17:42,196
But at... at this point,
the majority of
the parents don't.

1380
01:17:42,296 --> 01:17:45,299
They're worried
their kids will feel
unsafe, and obviously,

1381
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:48,202
that's not, you know,
completely unwarranted.

1382
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:50,371
Why don't we make it easier
on everyone and you just...

1383
01:17:50,471 --> 01:17:51,672
Why don't
you take my side, Janet?

1384
01:17:51,772 --> 01:17:53,040
Sophie shouldn't have
to be punished

1385
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:55,644
just because you want
to make a point.

1386
01:17:55,743 --> 01:17:57,211
Don't make us all die
on your hill.

1387
01:17:57,311 --> 01:18:00,948
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

1388
01:18:01,048 --> 01:18:03,150
Do you own that car
that says, "Loser"?

1389
01:18:04,385 --> 01:18:05,352
Yes.

1390
01:18:09,156 --> 01:18:10,724
Where do I begin?

1391
01:18:12,993 --> 01:18:14,995
Let me start with this.

1392
01:18:15,095 --> 01:18:17,031
I'm sorry.

1393
01:18:17,131 --> 01:18:20,267
I'm sorry, I didn't
address this earlier.

1394
01:18:20,367 --> 01:18:23,204
I'm sorry to anyone who's
had one of those terrible,

1395
01:18:23,304 --> 01:18:24,972
terrible nightmares.

1396
01:18:27,274 --> 01:18:31,111
The reason why
I'm so emotionally distressed

1397
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:34,048
right now is because
I had one myself.

1398
01:18:34,148 --> 01:18:38,018
I've experienced what
so many of you must
have experienced...

1399
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:44,124
being violently attacked
and abused by a man

1400
01:18:44,225 --> 01:18:45,259
who looks like me.

1401
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,162
I have to stress,
that man is not me.

1402
01:18:50,064 --> 01:18:53,934
And I speak now from
actual lived experience.

1403
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:57,871
I'm one of you.

1404
01:19:02,876 --> 01:19:09,950
I've been vilified in my life,
haunted in my dreams.

1405
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:12,219
My mere presence
upsets people

1406
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:15,289
and not because
I've actually done anything.

1407
01:19:17,491 --> 01:19:21,095
But because people imagine
I've done things.

1408
01:19:22,463 --> 01:19:26,033
Is it really fair that
I should be punished for that?

1409
01:19:28,335 --> 01:19:33,040
Am I not the biggest victim
in this whole phenomenon?

1410
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:37,077
Just look at how
it's affecting my life!

1411
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:40,281
<i>But because people imagine</i>
<i>I've done things.</i>

1412
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:41,815
I'm actually gonna
have to kill myself.

1413
01:19:41,915 --> 01:19:43,117
<i>Is it really fair that</i>

1414
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:44,451
<i>I should be</i>
<i>punished for that?</i>

1415
01:19:44,552 --> 01:19:46,253
-What is he doing?
<i>-Am I not the biggest</i>

1416
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:48,122
<i>victim in this</i>
<i>whole phenomenon?</i>

1417
01:19:48,222 --> 01:19:49,323
Fuck.

1418
01:19:49,423 --> 01:19:52,560
It was completely
insincere and self-serving.

1419
01:19:52,661 --> 01:19:54,763
What?
Which part?

1420
01:19:54,862 --> 01:19:56,397
All of it.

1421
01:19:57,431 --> 01:19:58,932
It's embarrassing, Paul.

1422
01:19:59,033 --> 01:20:01,435
It's embarrassing to be
married to you right now.

1423
01:20:08,075 --> 01:20:09,843
Thanks for letting me stay.

1424
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,279
Yeah.
Uh, just a heads up.

1425
01:20:12,379 --> 01:20:14,248
My wife's not
too hot on the idea,

1426
01:20:14,348 --> 01:20:18,553
<i>so I think it's gonna be in</i>
<i>the basement, if that's okay.</i>

1427
01:20:18,653 --> 01:20:19,887
What's the smell?

1428
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:21,756
I think that's
the propane tank.

1429
01:20:21,855 --> 01:20:23,357
I'll crack open a window.

1430
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:26,460
I... I can't just sleep
on the couch upstairs?

1431
01:20:26,561 --> 01:20:28,162
I'm sorry, man.

1432
01:20:29,631 --> 01:20:33,535
If you need anything,
just text me, I'll come down.

1433
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:35,436
-Thanks.
-Okay.

1434
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:08,328
Excuse me. Sir.

1435
01:22:08,429 --> 01:22:10,532
I'm seeing my daughter.
She's on stage.

1436
01:22:10,632 --> 01:22:12,901
You're Mr. Matthews, right?

1437
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,402
-No.
-You're not Paul Matthews?

1438
01:22:15,502 --> 01:22:17,070
No.

1439
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:20,642
Call security.

1440
01:22:36,825 --> 01:22:38,992
You can't be here, Paul.

1441
01:22:39,092 --> 01:22:40,961
Let me just watch,
I'll leave before it's over.

1442
01:22:41,061 --> 01:22:42,797
-I thought we had an agreement.
-Come on.

1443
01:22:42,897 --> 01:22:44,498
I just want to watch
for a few minutes.

1444
01:22:44,599 --> 01:22:46,868
-Respect our boundaries.
-This is ridiculous.

1445
01:22:46,967 --> 01:22:49,002
-Let me in.
-Paul!

1446
01:22:55,910 --> 01:23:00,715
Ah!

1447
01:23:05,118 --> 01:23:06,621
He attacked me.

1448
01:23:08,556 --> 01:23:11,124
He... Paul Matthews
attacked me!

1449
01:23:11,225 --> 01:23:13,193
It was an accident.

1450
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:15,295
She wouldn't let me in.

1451
01:23:15,763 --> 01:23:17,331
I just want to see my daughter.

1452
01:23:19,634 --> 01:23:22,002
She wouldn't let me in.

1453
01:23:22,102 --> 01:23:23,638
It was an accident.

1454
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:28,275
I just want to see my daughter.

1455
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:31,144
-Hey, stop.
-No, it was an accident.

1456
01:23:31,245 --> 01:23:34,682
It was an accident.
Sophie, it was an accident.

1457
01:23:34,782 --> 01:23:36,149
Hold it!

1458
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:38,318
So... Sophie,
it was an accident.

1459
01:23:39,888 --> 01:23:42,657
Get off me!
Get off of me!

1460
01:23:59,306 --> 01:24:00,975
<i>An average man,</i>

1461
01:24:01,074 --> 01:24:03,176
<i>a cultural sensation,</i>

1462
01:24:03,277 --> 01:24:05,847
<i>a dream turned</i>
<i>into a nightmare.</i>

1463
01:24:05,947 --> 01:24:07,414
<i>For a period,</i>
<i>going to sleep</i>

1464
01:24:07,515 --> 01:24:10,018
<i>meant risking abuse</i>
<i>from this man.</i>

1465
01:24:10,117 --> 01:24:11,653
<i>Though we still</i>
<i>don't understand how</i>

1466
01:24:11,753 --> 01:24:14,789
<i>this phenomenon started</i>
<i>or why it suddenly stopped,</i>

1467
01:24:14,889 --> 01:24:17,324
<i>we can rest assured that</i>
<i>after violently attacking</i>

1468
01:24:17,424 --> 01:24:19,226
<i>a middle school teacher</i>
<i>last fall,</i>

1469
01:24:19,326 --> 01:24:21,529
<i>Paul Matthews disappeared</i>
<i>from the public eye</i>

1470
01:24:21,629 --> 01:24:23,665
<i>and our collective dreams,</i>
<i>all together.</i>

1471
01:24:23,765 --> 01:24:27,200
<i>But through the case of Paul</i>
<i>came one silver lining,</i>

1472
01:24:27,301 --> 01:24:29,671
<i>a revolution</i>
<i>in dream science.</i>

1473
01:24:29,771 --> 01:24:33,841
<i>So now forget the nightmares</i>
<i>and experience a positive way</i>

1474
01:24:33,942 --> 01:24:35,510
<i>of dream travel with Norio.</i>

1475
01:24:35,610 --> 01:24:37,444
Welcome to the Dream House!

1476
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,446
<i>This is the Dream House</i>

1477
01:24:39,547 --> 01:24:41,081
<i>on top of</i>
<i>the Hollywood Hills,</i>

1478
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:43,017
<i>where the next big thing</i>
<i>is happening,</i>

1479
01:24:43,116 --> 01:24:45,152
<i>ads in your dreams.</i>

1480
01:24:45,252 --> 01:24:47,922
"Dreamfluencers,"
or, like, "mindvertisers."

1481
01:24:49,489 --> 01:24:51,291
I don't think there's
like an official title yet.

1482
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:53,795
Well, I think
social media is over.

1483
01:24:53,895 --> 01:24:57,932
Like if you can
promote a song
or a product actually

1484
01:24:58,032 --> 01:25:01,803
in someone's head
then that's, like,
way more powerful.

1485
01:25:01,903 --> 01:25:04,606
<i>If one man could</i>
<i>enter other people's dreams,</i>

1486
01:25:04,706 --> 01:25:06,074
<i>couldn't any of us?</i>

1487
01:25:06,173 --> 01:25:07,609
<i>One scientist set out</i>
<i>to find a way.</i>

1488
01:25:07,709 --> 01:25:10,177
We had to rethink
the whole field.

1489
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:14,348
Consciousness is
more complex
than we thought.

1490
01:25:14,448 --> 01:25:17,384
Dualism was right.
Jung was right.

1491
01:25:17,484 --> 01:25:19,787
There is a collective
subconscious.

1492
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:23,925
Paul Matthews proved that,
even if accidentally.

1493
01:25:24,025 --> 01:25:27,996
<i>The Norio would definitely</i>
<i>not exist without him.</i>

1494
01:25:28,096 --> 01:25:31,198
<i>Brian Berg</i>
<i>is the inventor of the Norio,</i>

1495
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:34,902
<i>a device that makes</i>
<i>it possible to dream travel.</i>

1496
01:25:35,003 --> 01:25:38,138
It's like meditation
or hypnagogia.

1497
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:39,707
<i>Using neurotechnology,</i>

1498
01:25:39,807 --> 01:25:43,176
<i>the Norio allows you to visit</i>
<i>anyone in their dreams.</i>

1499
01:25:43,276 --> 01:25:45,513
<i>It may look like</i>
<i>he's just resting.</i>

1500
01:25:45,613 --> 01:25:47,815
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>Brian's inside the dream</i>

1501
01:25:47,915 --> 01:25:51,485
<i>of a random 19-year-old boy</i>
<i>in South Korea.</i>

1502
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,220
It's refreshing.

1503
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:54,656
I feel like
if people are judging it,

1504
01:25:54,756 --> 01:25:56,824
then they don't really
understand it.

1505
01:25:56,924 --> 01:25:58,092
It's not weird.

1506
01:25:58,191 --> 01:26:00,394
It's just like,
we're gonna be in your dream

1507
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:02,329
for a brief moment.
We're gonna showcase

1508
01:26:02,429 --> 01:26:05,232
some merch or play
a hot new track
and say a few things

1509
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:06,834
and then we're out.
That's it.

1510
01:26:06,934 --> 01:26:08,803
<i>Paul Matthews</i>
<i>left many skeptical</i>

1511
01:26:08,903 --> 01:26:10,203
<i>about dream travel.</i>

1512
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:12,807
<i>But the Norio has</i>
<i>a no-nightmare guarantee.</i>

1513
01:26:12,907 --> 01:26:14,441
<i>Without enthusiastic consent</i>

1514
01:26:14,542 --> 01:26:16,443
<i>the dream will</i>
<i>simply be terminated.</i>

1515
01:26:16,544 --> 01:26:19,179
I mean, people always
use Paul Matthews as

1516
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:20,480
the cautionary tale.

1517
01:26:20,581 --> 01:26:23,818
Okay, this industry
might not exist without him.

1518
01:26:23,918 --> 01:26:26,486
But also, he put such
a negative stamp on it.

1519
01:26:26,587 --> 01:26:30,190
It's kind of insane
that he harnessed
all of this power,

1520
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:32,927
-just so he could
terrorize people.
Mmm-hmm.

1521
01:26:35,863 --> 01:26:36,898
Okay.

1522
01:26:39,133 --> 01:26:41,936
Ah. Nice.

1523
01:26:43,571 --> 01:26:45,807
Okay, girls,
wanna look at the bedrooms

1524
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:47,274
and see which ones you like?

1525
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,443
I don't like it.

1526
01:26:49,544 --> 01:26:51,244
Go look at the bedrooms,
please.

1527
01:27:00,454 --> 01:27:03,256
So, my friend actually
used to have those dreams.

1528
01:27:03,356 --> 01:27:05,860
Or so she claimed, at least.

1529
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,662
Oh. Ha, yeah.

1530
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:22,510
So, what happened?
Like, they just stopped or...

1531
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:25,113
I just feel like I haven't
heard of them in a while.

1532
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:26,446
Yeah. I don't know.

1533
01:27:26,547 --> 01:27:28,916
People stopped
having them, I guess.

1534
01:27:29,016 --> 01:27:31,485
If I hear anything now,
it's mostly abroad.

1535
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:34,421
What's the smell?

1536
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:38,358
Oh, I was told that the old
owners were big animal lovers.

1537
01:27:38,458 --> 01:27:40,260
I'm sure
it'll air out in time.

1538
01:27:40,928 --> 01:27:43,396
Um, hey, before you leave,

1539
01:27:43,497 --> 01:27:47,001
have you seen that guy Chris
around the house lately?

1540
01:27:47,935 --> 01:27:49,971
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1541
01:27:50,071 --> 01:27:51,539
Maybe, like,
a week ago, I think.

1542
01:27:51,639 --> 01:27:54,642
-Is he here often?
-I mean, not really.

1543
01:27:55,475 --> 01:27:56,911
Does he stay over?

1544
01:27:57,845 --> 01:27:59,046
I don't think so.

1545
01:28:00,081 --> 01:28:01,749
Hannah, does he stay over?

1546
01:28:01,849 --> 01:28:02,817
I don't know.

1547
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,320
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

1548
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:08,990
-I love you.
-Love you!

1549
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:11,424
I'll bring you back
something cool from France.

1550
01:28:11,526 --> 01:28:13,227
-Hi.
-Hi.

1551
01:28:13,326 --> 01:28:14,862
How was the place?

1552
01:28:14,962 --> 01:28:17,265
Yeah, you know, it was nice.

1553
01:28:17,364 --> 01:28:19,700
-Good location.
-Good.

1554
01:28:19,801 --> 01:28:21,736
I don't think Sophie
really liked it.

1555
01:28:21,836 --> 01:28:26,339
She kept asking,
"Why don't you just
move back in with us?"

1556
01:28:26,439 --> 01:28:28,341
Yeah.

1557
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:29,977
And cost-wise, good?

1558
01:28:30,077 --> 01:28:31,546
You know,
between the settlement

1559
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:34,715
from Osler and the book deal,
I should be fine.

1560
01:28:35,783 --> 01:28:39,419
-More than fine, actually.
-Okay, great.

1561
01:28:40,855 --> 01:28:44,959
Have you been seeing me in
your dreams lately, by the way?

1562
01:28:45,059 --> 01:28:47,795
No. Why do you
keep asking?

1563
01:28:48,095 --> 01:28:49,564
I'm just curious.

1564
01:28:50,497 --> 01:28:53,000
-Shit, I'm late.
-Where are you going?

1565
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:55,236
Well, I've got a Zoom call
with the publisher.

1566
01:28:55,335 --> 01:28:57,337
They're trying
to expand the tour.

1567
01:28:57,437 --> 01:29:00,407
I might be a whole month
now in Paris.

1568
01:29:00,508 --> 01:29:02,543
-It's crazy.
-That's exciting.

1569
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,583
I guess I won't see you
before you leave, then?

1570
01:29:08,683 --> 01:29:11,384
I leave in four days.
I can swing by.

1571
01:29:33,641 --> 01:29:35,776
No, it's fine.
I'll see you when you're back.

1572
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:40,548
Yeah. Okay.

1573
01:29:44,685 --> 01:29:45,920
Bye.

1574
01:29:47,788 --> 01:29:49,023
Bye, Paul.

1575
01:30:21,789 --> 01:30:24,091
Hey, Paul.

1576
01:30:24,191 --> 01:30:25,726
I love those on you.

1577
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:29,496
Hey, come on, try them out.
Dance with me.

1578
01:30:30,398 --> 01:30:31,799
Get out.

1579
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:34,434
-Get out!
-No, no, try to dance.

1580
01:30:38,706 --> 01:30:40,574
Please don't hit Dylan.

1581
01:30:41,776 --> 01:30:44,111
'Cause your punches will
pack more heat with these

1582
01:30:44,211 --> 01:30:48,015
ultra-yummy keto supplements
from Alpha Monster Gains.

1583
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:49,617
Oh, fuck, let me just
take that again. I'm sorry.

1584
01:30:49,717 --> 01:30:52,019
Your punches will pack
more heat with these

1585
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:55,222
ultra-yummy keto supplements
from Ultra Yummy...

1586
01:30:55,323 --> 01:30:56,824
-Oh, fuck.
-Wait a minute.

1587
01:30:56,924 --> 01:30:58,592
Where's the...

1588
01:31:22,183 --> 01:31:24,352
So, first up is a magazine
called Rue Morgue.

1589
01:31:24,452 --> 01:31:27,621
They write about
myths, cults, horror
movies, stuff like that.

1590
01:31:27,722 --> 01:31:29,357
Did you bring a copy
of the book?

1591
01:31:29,457 --> 01:31:30,758
No, no. It's going straight
to the stores

1592
01:31:30,858 --> 01:31:32,793
and we'll see it there.

1593
01:31:44,572 --> 01:31:46,374
Can you put it on for me?

1594
01:31:46,474 --> 01:31:48,209
Uh, I'd rather not.

1595
01:31:51,112 --> 01:31:53,514
No, it's just, I don't want to.

1596
01:31:53,614 --> 01:31:55,049
You don't want to?

1597
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:58,152
The glove is cool and
I think you should wear it.

1598
01:31:58,252 --> 01:31:59,553
Can I say no?

1599
01:31:59,653 --> 01:32:01,389
Come on. It makes sense.

1600
01:32:01,489 --> 01:32:03,591
You are nightmare guy,
it's totally cool.

1601
01:32:18,806 --> 01:32:20,374
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

1602
01:32:20,474 --> 01:32:22,410
<i>And this is the most</i>
<i>important step.</i>

1603
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:25,346
<i>Set an intention</i>
<i>for your visitation.</i>

1604
01:32:25,446 --> 01:32:26,680
No, it's still
at the store.

1605
01:32:26,781 --> 01:32:28,582
I think they just changed
the room or something.

1606
01:32:29,483 --> 01:32:30,851
Maybe they needed
a bigger space.

1607
01:32:30,951 --> 01:32:32,286
<i>To successfully enter</i>

1608
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:35,890
<i>someone's dream is gonna</i>
<i>require a lot of practice.</i>

1609
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:38,459
<i>Getting the Norio</i>
<i>is just the first step.</i>

1610
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:40,261
Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Paul.

1611
01:32:42,296 --> 01:32:45,433
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Wow, big turnout.

1612
01:32:45,534 --> 01:32:48,502
Oh, uh, no,
that is for the other event.

1613
01:32:48,602 --> 01:32:50,237
I... I... I'm so sorry.

1614
01:32:50,337 --> 01:32:51,540
There was a conflict.

1615
01:32:51,639 --> 01:32:53,641
Um, they had to move
you downstairs,

1616
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:55,876
but come, come, this way.

1617
01:32:58,813 --> 01:33:00,781
Voila.
This is it.

1618
01:33:01,749 --> 01:33:04,018
-Is that the book?
-Hmm.

1619
01:33:04,118 --> 01:33:06,921
I haven't actually seen
a physical copy of it yet.

1620
01:33:12,059 --> 01:33:13,260
Okay.

1621
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,029
Wow. It's so thin.

1622
01:33:15,129 --> 01:33:18,165
Must have gotten shorter
in translation.

1623
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,203
They changed the title, too?

1624
01:33:22,303 --> 01:33:23,804
I Am Your Nightmare.

1625
01:33:23,904 --> 01:33:27,475
-That... that is not the title?
-No.

1626
01:33:27,576 --> 01:33:29,810
It was supposed to be
<i>Dream Scenario.</i>

1627
01:33:31,045 --> 01:33:34,014
But this is...
this is fine, I guess.

1628
01:33:35,216 --> 01:33:37,552
Yeah, it's... it's fine.

1629
01:33:37,651 --> 01:33:40,087
It probably works better
for the demographic.

1630
01:33:46,093 --> 01:33:47,928
<i>Who do I make it out to?</i>

1631
01:33:53,568 --> 01:33:55,102
Fuck!

1632
01:33:55,202 --> 01:33:56,704
Shit. Fuck.

1633
01:33:56,804 --> 01:33:59,740
Are you all right? Jean!

1634
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,076
Fuck, where'd
he go? Jean!

1635
01:34:03,711 --> 01:34:05,179
Fuck.

1636
01:34:15,524 --> 01:34:17,958
<i>Hey guys, it's Liam.</i>
<i>Today, I'll be teaching you</i>

1637
01:34:18,058 --> 01:34:22,597
<i>how to enter someone else's</i>
<i>dream using the Norio.</i>

1638
01:34:22,696 --> 01:34:24,533
<i>Think of it as a meditation.</i>

1639
01:34:24,633 --> 01:34:27,636
<i>Close your eyes,</i>
<i>relax your body,</i>

1640
01:34:27,735 --> 01:34:31,205
<i>and hyper-focus</i>
<i>on the person whose dream</i>

1641
01:34:31,305 --> 01:34:33,707
<i>you're trying to enter.</i>

1642
01:34:33,807 --> 01:34:36,243
<i>Try to pick someone</i>
<i>who welcomes your presence,</i>

1643
01:34:37,378 --> 01:34:38,179
<i>or else this whole thing</i>

1644
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:40,948
<i>will be pretty much</i>
<i>impossible.</i>

1645
01:34:41,048 --> 01:34:44,018
<i>So, once you have</i>
<i>your dreamer locked in,</i>

1646
01:34:44,118 --> 01:34:45,986
<i>the Norio will do the rest...</i>

1647
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:00,662
I wish this was real.
